"But if you concentrated on getting a good maintenance contract with the lift engineers we would not be on this position",""
"Yes, I know I've been renewing this contract for a long time.",""
"But, you know, my schedule is absolutely full, I never have time to deal with these practical details.",""
"I'll have to ask Archibald to handle this urgently.",""
"Okay, we talk, we talk, but we're still stuck.",""
"I'm gonna push the backup button.",""
"I pushed the emergency button half an hour ago",""
"Nothing is happening",""
"Are you picking up the network with your phone?",""
"I ve also tried my phone but that is not connecting",""
"Neither is mine.",""
"Well, we need to figure this out.",""
"Do you know how to scream very loud, or sing very loud?",""
"I am getting fed up now",""
"Yeah, me too, to be honest.",""
"If we have to stay here much longer, you can work.",""
"I only have my book, and I'm almost done.",""
"Well I can tell you for nothing I am not going to work in here",""
"Anyway, I'm glad it's you that I'm stuck in this elevator, and not Archibald.",""
"He would have been unbearable.",""
"He would have yelled at me, with no respect for his boss.",""
"I m very tempted to yell too",""
"Maybe I will and someone might hear us and come to the rescue",""
"Yes, go ahead, we can try!",""
"Aaaaaaah,",""
"You're shaking, are you okay?",""
"Hello, yes I'm feeling very anxious.",""
"This is my first time flying and I'm not sure what to expect.",""
"Really?",""
"It's my first time, too, it's crazy!",""
"I'm pretty stressed, too, you know that a plane went down just yesterday in Texas?",""
"So we're in the same situation.",""
"That's terrible and knowing that doesn't help my nerves.",""
"My doctor has given me some pills to calm me down but they don't seem to be working.",""
"Tell me about it, I'm sure it's a placebo what he gave you.",""
"Look, my hands are shaking, too.",""
"What a pair we are!",""
"Maybe a drink will calm us.",""
"Good idea!",""
"How about a whiskey?",""
"That sounds good.",""
"Or if they haven't got a whiskey, a brandy.",""
"Are you travelling for work or a holiday?",""
"I'm going to a seminar on the fear of the plane.",""
"I hope it helps!",""
"Maybe they'll give us a drink!",""
"Your seminar sounds interesting.",""
"I'm visiting a friend.",""
"I hope she's there to collect me when I arrive.",""
"The test of your seminar will be when you have to fly back!",""
"Oh, no.",""
"Your friend will probably be here, why?",""
"Unless she has a car accident, of course.",""
"Well I hope not, otherwise I don't know what I'll do!",""
"I'll be all alone in a strange country.",""
"And I don't speak the language.",""
"You're not talking about the Lithuanian?",""
"Don't worry, I'm sure we'll all be there, your friend there.",""
"Fingers crossed.",""
"Enjoy your seminar.",""
"Thank you!",""
"He's scheduled to be completely in Lithuanian, and I will understand nothing.",""
"Never mind.",""
"Hello, what can you lose in this evil forest?",""
"How are you planning on getting out of this?",""
"I'm scared.",""
"I don't know.",""
"You look like you know the outdoors better than me.",""
"I've already cut my knee on a twig and grazed my head too.",""
"That's sad!",""
"But don't worry!",""
"The medicinal herbs will allow you to heal and get back on your feet!",""
"We're going to get these herbs and try to make it an ointment.",""
"Then we can try to call for help by building a musical instrument.",""
"'cause here I don't have a signal",""
"Do you?",""
"No.",""
"But why a musical instrument?",""
"Wouldn't a wolf whistle work better?",""
"Because an instrument allows us to communicate remotely without a signal.",""
"Based on the traditional method of communication, we might be able to get us out of this wrong.",""
"I'm not sure what a wrong is, but if you really think you can do it, go ahead.",""
"What kind of instrument were you thinking of?",""
"A wooden one I suppose...",""
"We can make a Tam Tam, but we need buffalo skin!",""
"Or make a cry for help with a big fire.",""
"We can use the smoke to communicate in Morse code.",""
"You're full of ideas today!",""
"But you do seem a bit unrealistic.",""
"Unless you know of a buffalo shop around here?",""
"Although you may be onto something with your idea of the fire.",""
"Haha, there's no store like this.",""
"But, yes, fire can serve us.",""
"Do you have any other ideas that come to mind?",""
"Because moving blind with a wounded knee doesn't seem like a good idea to me.",""
"We could just sit here and wait for somebody to find us.",""
"I'm tired.",""
"I could watch you make a fire!",""
"Now that's a good idea!",""
"Why bother?",""
"I'm never going to pass, so I might as well give up now.",""
"You have all the ability to succeed.",""
"Don't be discouraged.",""
"How do you know that?",""
"You're not in my head!",""
"Your copies and your questions show that you're brilliant.",""
"I bet you say that to everybody.",""
"I'm rubbish at maths, rubbish at science.",""
"And I just glued my hand to the desk in Art.",""
"There's an internship next week.",""
"He might make you feel better.",""
"You can ask all the questions that will be left after your studying this weekend.",""
"What do you mean?",""
"Who am I going to ask?",""
"I don't even think I'll have any questions 'cause I understand so little.",""
"All the teachers will be available.",""
"Start with simple questions.",""
"Why me?",""
"Like that?",""
"On top of that, there will be cake in this review internship.",""
"As a consolation, right?",""
"And, seriously, do you ever really use anything you learnt in class?",""
"We'll leave the basics if we need to, but we can't give up.",""
"Wow, I thought you would tell me that we need the basics!",""
"Are you sure about that?",""
"On what part of the program do you think you're lost?",""
"Where do I start?",""
"It's a bit embarrassing, but I've never been any good at my times tables...",""
"The multiplication tables?",""
"Yeah, I know it's stupid.",""
"But my teacher back in school used to spend all her time knitting in class and would never explain anything properly.",""
"And now, years later, look where I am!",""
"So we'll take a little time every day of the next week to review tables.",""
"What other parts of the program seem to be difficult?",""
"You would do that for me?",""
"Wow, you're the first teacher who's ever done anything nice for me!",""
"I do struggle with French too...",""
"I just can't get the grammar.",""
"My teacher keeps telling me that I sound like I'm translating word by word.",""
"Which is sort of true...",""
"Maybe you can use a computer translator to help you?",""
"There's some more advanced software in the field.",""
"Isn't that cheating?",""
"They might notice if I bring my laptop to the exam.",""
"I always have some leftover bread and I like to come here and enjoy the quiet.",""
"And you?",""
"What brings you here?",""
"Hello, yes it's a lovely day.",""
"I work from home and it's nice to get out and be with people as it's quite lonely not seeing anyone all day.",""
"That's for sure!",""
"What do you do for a living?",""
"My favourite water bird is the swan.",""
"They're nesting over there and it looks as if the babies will hatch out soon.",""
"I'm a journalist, so a very solitary profession.",""
"I prefer ducks, I think that swans can be mean.",""
"But it's true that babies are cute.",""
"Yes the swans can be quite aggressive.",""
"The ducks are pretty, particularly the males.",""
"What do you do for a living?",""
"Journalist, must be a tough job, huh?",""
"I'm a computer computer, and I work from home, too.",""
"The advantage is freedom.",""
"It can be difficult at times, particularly when I have too many deadlines, but it's rewarding when you see your article in print.",""
"You print under an alias or your real name?",""
"Yes there is that.",""
"I can do the odd jobs round the house in-between writing.",""
"I use an alias, as there are a lot of weird people out there.",""
"It protects me from social media intrusion.",""
"What does your job involve?",""
"I'm developing software for companies.",""
"I specialize in artificial intelligence.",""
"But I also do Web development, it pays the bills.",""
"I guess it saves you from being harassed.",""
"What subjects do you write about?",""
"Medicine and healthcare and our National Health Service which is always in the news for not having enough money to keep it going",""
"Your job sounds very interesting",""
"That's a real problem.",""
"If we keep it that way, we'll go into the wall, for sure.",""
"It's not bad and varied as work!",""
"It's pretty cool in every day, it's true.",""
"I'm gonna have to leave you two alone.",""
"I'm out of bread and it's getting late.",""
"It's been a pleasure.",""
"Thanks for chatting.",""
"Enjoy the rest of your day",""
"You too, see you soon.",""
"You don't look so good.",""
"I'm not feeling too well.",""
"This is my first time flying.",""
"Really?",""
"Don't worry, everything's going to be fine!",""
"How can you be so sure?!",""
"Are you an engineer?",""
"No, but the engineers who do the planes know what they're doing!",""
"And pilots!",""
"That's what pilots do, not anyone you know!",""
"They do years and years of studying!",""
"true.",""
"but it is still very scary.",""
"have you ever flown in a plane before?",""
"Yes, I take the plane very often.",""
"Look out the window!",""
"Look how beautiful it is, this sea of clouds...",""
"really?!",""
"Does it get any easier?",""
"wow!",""
"the clouds are beautiful but we are so high up!",""
"a sea of clouds to drown in",""
"It's poetic what you say, but it's not very positive!",""
"Let's see, a little bit of courage.",""
"All we have is 1 2: 30.",""
"i'm sorry, i'm just not used to being in a plane.",""
"12:30... i don't get it?",""
"I mean, before we get to Australia, we've only got 12 or 13 hours left.",""
"It's quiet, isn't it?",""
"12 or 13 hours?!",""
"are you kidding me?!",""
"Oh sweet jesus.",""
"we're all going to die",""
"Haha!",""
"You know, the length doesn't change anything!",""
"Statistically, accidents usually happen at takeoff or landing.",""
"Thanks for your help.",""
"I'm going to talk to someone who actually cares.",""
"As you wish.",""
"Go on, have fun!",""
"Hello Sandra, I have something to ask you for the next class",""
"Can't you ask me now, I might not be here at the next class",""
"The weather is so nice I fancy taking a day off",""
"I remind you that class is required.",""
"You'll be enjoying the weather in a few weeks.",""
"But I can revise outside, there is not a lot of point being stuck in here",""
"Besides the weather might break",""
"Especially for next week, I need you to do a presentation on your favorite subject:",""
"I usually do most of my homework and I do turn up generally",""
"And what do you think is my favourite subject?",""
"I'm sure, given the quality of your memory on this subject, that you are passionate about the future of worms.",""
"I want all of the students to benefit from your expertise.",""
"I could sing a funny English song about dead bodies, the worms go in and the worms go out",""
"I ll have to try and remember it from when I was younger",""
"Have you been drinking?",""
"I remind you we're in college!",""
"I'm not interested in child songs.",""
"It would be funny though and it would get other students to pay attention",""
"Often students fall asleep so something to grab their attention might be just the thing",""
"Oh and no I ve not been drinking, not even tequila with a worm in the bottom of the bottle!",""
"I see you have a lot of mind.",""
"We'll see if you have so much on the next exam!",""
"I warn you, I'll be particularly demanding towards you.",""
"I just checked and you can find the song on you tube 'the hearse song'",""
"Do listen, you might enjoy it.",""
"You don't smile very often",""
"I appreciate your advice, but I remind you that I'm the teacher, and you're the student.",""
"So I'm the one giving the advice.",""
"And now, I advise you to work hard and come next week with a report for your comrades.",""
"Maybe we should have some tequila together and that may help our relationship",""
"Your offer makes me very uncomfortable.",""
"I'd rather stop this conversation.",""
"See you in a week, your job will have better be good!",""
"Hi, how are you?",""
"It's been a few weeks since we've seen each other.",""
"I am ok, I find some of the other residents a bit annoying",""
"you are very kind to visit me so often",""
"Really?",""
"You don't find conversation issues with them?",""
"They can be much older than you.",""
"I don't think its an age thing, its an attitude of mind",""
"I don't know why some old people have to grumble and moan so much",""
"it is dispiriting",""
"I understand.",""
"But do you guys have any activities where you're all together: Walk, board games, shows...?",""
"We do have various activities, but sing-a-long war time songs, I ask you!!",""
"Just because we are old does not mean we have lost all sense of taste",""
"No, of course.",""
"I hope in this case you go out, even alone, take walks.",""
"And I hope you still play the guitar!",""
"My hands are a bit too arthritic now for making music but my grandson does visit and play for me sometimes",""
"The staff are very strict about allowing residents to go out on their own",""
"they worry about health and safety; falls etc and then having to fill in lots of paperwork I guess",""
"That's very nice of your grandson.",""
"Even if the staff is strict, for security reasons, you still get along well with them?",""
"they are fine and I make them laugh",""
"you know I ve a wicked sense of humour, mind you, I am not sure they always get me",""
"If you make them laugh, it's a good sign.",""
"What about the food?",""
"I remember you telling me she wasn't so good.",""
"I can bring you some cookies if you want!",""
"Oooh I love cookies, yes please.",""
"I thik the cook thinks everybody has dodgy false teeth or even no teeth at all",""
"the food is just mushy",""
"Well, it doesn't have to be too bad.",""
"There's a restaurant nearby, you could go from time to time, even if the staff doesn't like to go out.",""
"What a surprise to see you.",""
"Were you passing by or have you made a special trip to see me?",""
"I came to see you.",""
"It's been over a month since we met.",""
"How are you?",""
"Health?",""
"I'm very well thank you.",""
"The doctor gave me a check-up last week and said I was as fit as a fiddle.",""
"Not bad for someone eighty five years old.",""
"I've just had my lunch but would you like me to ask someone to get a cup of tea or coffee for you?",""
"It makes me happy to know your health is good.",""
"Yes, I'll have a cup of coffee.",""
"And how are things here?",""
"Are you always so satisfied with your retirement home?",""
"I think I remember that the food is not very good.",""
"I'll ring the bell to get someone to get you a coffee.",""
"I was apprehensive about moving here from my old house, but I have settled in now.",""
"There is no way that I could have stayed any longer at home and looked after myself",""
"The food though is not very good.",""
"Yeah, that's what I remember about food.",""
"Do you go out once in a while?",""
"I hope the retirement home is about various activities.",""
"I go out once a week.",""
"They arrange a mini-bus which takes us somewhere interesting.",""
"last week we had a trip to Windsor Castle.",""
"There are activities too.",""
"I can throw a ball to other people here or I can go to poetry classes.",""
"It is very varied.",""
"Oh, right.",""
"And here even there's nothing?",""
"It seems to me that the last time a lecturer was supposed to be speaking of ancient Egypt.",""
"And the music?",""
"You still playing the piano, I hope?",""
"I do play the piano so,",""
"I do the piano sometimes.",""
"And once in a while someone comes in to entertain us.",""
"Anyway, that's enough about me.",""
"How are you doing?",""
"I'm fine and hoping to be as alert as you at 85 years old!",""
"That's good to know.",""
"I hope you can come again.",""
"Have a good journey home and send",""
"My best wishes to your family",""
"Good evening, my dear!",""
"How are you?",""
"How was your day?",""
"Hello!",""
"I'm so glad to be home",""
"I've had a horrible day",""
"Oh, my poor darling.",""
"What happened to you?",""
"I had to go to this retirement home and see an old friend and pretend to be in love with him, just to try and get his money in his will",""
"He is on his last legs you see",""
"And we so badly need the money",""
"But it smelt so badly of old people there - I'm glad to be home",""
"How was your day, sweet one?",""
"I'm fine, nothing special.",""
"Was it your dad's old friend, the kind of pervert who looks at all the girls with his fat-ass eyes?",""
"Yes, it was him!",""
"There was a poor girl there called Anya who we wouldn't leave alone",""
"She said afterwards to me she was going to get a restraining order against him",""
"I remember him, and it's true that he was always looking at you in a very inappropriate way.",""
"A young girl who works at the nursing home?",""
"Poor thing, spending her life in the middle of old, frustrated and old.",""
"Yes, but I never minded.",""
"He is so rich, I always thought I would get something out of it when he passed away.",""
"But now this Anya seems to be getting in there instead",""
"I don't feel that sorry for Anya, he will leave her lots of money I imagine",""
"In a way, she's gonna deserve it.",""
"But we really don't have much money these days.",""
"I know, but who's fault is that?",""
"You do like to gamble and drink a lot",""
"Yes, those are my little pleasures.",""
"But you also like a few glasses of good French wine for drinks.",""
"You have to enjoy life.",""
"You could try to convince the big pervert this Anya only wants her money, and that you're the only person who really loves her!",""
"That could work, old people are sometimes very paranoid.",""
"What a good idea!",""
"I need to turn him against Anya, and show him what a money-grabber she is",""
"Exactly!",""
"I might go call him now and start planting the seed of that idea",""
"Awesome!",""
"Soon, we will not be poor anymore!",""
"In the meantime, shall we open a bottle?",""
"Oh go on then, we do deserve it I suppose, it's been such a hard day",""
"Good evening, how was your day?",""
"Rubbish... I got soaked on the way to work, and then there was no way to dry my stuff, so I've been walking around in damp clothes all day.",""
"I just want to take a long hot shower and have a beer.",""
"How about you?",""
"How was your day?",""
"My poor baby, he was all wet all day long, I hope you didn't catch cold.",""
"I told you to dress up.",""
"The mini-skirt and the summer shoes, in April and in a long time, it's a risk.",""
"I stayed warm with the dog.",""
"As long as you're not asking me to watch football and warm up a frozen pizza, you can stay as long as you want in the shower and drink your beer.",""
"Yeah, but they're so comfortable, and when I left the house the sun way shining!",""
"Ouf... I wish I could have spent the day at home with the dog...",""
"He makes far better company than the people at work.",""
"You know I can't stand the football, and frozen pizza... I'd rather order in Indian food",""
"Will you order it while I'm in the shower... I'll have my usual.",""
"Since you're all wet, take the time to get the dog out, I'll run you a bath and order Indian.",""
"Ok, it can't really make it any worse than it already is, and it's not good for him to be inside all day!",""
"You're kidding, he's an apartment dog, when I tried to get him out in the rain, he just wouldn't come out, he just peed on the corner, and he was already shooting on his leash to get home.",""
"He didn't used to be, you've spoiled him way too much!",""
"He needs to get used to bad weather, we are planning to move to the west coast of Brittany after all!",""
"Not at all, you plan to move to Lapland.",""
"I'm a sensitive and fragile character, just like my little dog.",""
"In any case the weather in Lapland is wonderful.",""
"I like the sun.",""
"I hate this country, or it does a terrible time 9 months a year.",""
"It is far less humid and the northern lights are beautiful.",""
"Maybe for popsicles, but not for me.",""
"I want sun.",""
"I will always be on a cruise to the polar circle, where to attend the white parties of St. Petersburg, but not to live north of 45-th parallel.",""
"Excuse me, north of 45th parallel.",""
"You want me to bring your beer in your bath?",""
"Ooh, yeah please!",""
"That would be great :)",""
"Ok, I'm going to head out with the dog!",""
"See you in a bit",""
"Okay.",""
"Hello.",""
"What can I get you?",""
"Coffee and orange juice.",""
"OK.",""
"Is that a small orange juice?",""
"And would you like ice in it?",""
"How would you like your coffee?",""
"Cappuccio?",""
"Flat White?",""
"Americano?",""
"More like a big glass of squeezed orange juice, no ice.",""
"Yes I can do that for you.",""
"It will take a minute to squeeze the orange juice.",""
"It's a white coffee, because I've never tasted it.",""
"What's it like?",""
"It's very good - the best in town!",""
"I'll make you some and you can see what you think.",""
"Are you visiting the town/ I don't think I have seen you in here before.",""
"All right;",""
"Yes, I'm just passing through this town for a work meeting.",""
"What's interesting to see?",""
"The art gallery is interesting.",""
"They have a special exihibition at the moment on Vincent Van Gogh.",""
"Or you could visit the cathedral.",""
"Where the art and the cathedral are located.",""
"Is it far from here?",""
"The art gallery is just a hundred metres from the bar.",""
"Turn left and you will find it.",""
"The cathedral is a bit further.",""
"All right.",""
"Otherwise, I just had a taste of your white-mouth coffee.",""
"Not so good.",""
"What do you put in it?",""
"Maple syrup?",""
"It's a special recipe.",""
"I'm not allowed to say!",""
"Can I get you something else instead?",""
"No, thanks.",""
"Do you have any other special recipes here?",""
"Otherwise, I'd like a little sugar and a straw for my orange juice.",""
"No other special recipes.Only coffee English style.",""
"Would you like to sit at a table and i will bring your orange juice over to you?",""
"Yes, thank you.",""
"RIght I'll do that and then I need to serve the customer who has just come in.",""
"I hope you enjoy the orange juice and get to see the art gallery.",""
"Thanks very much for your custom.",""
"Hello my dear, it's been a while!",""
"Oh, how nice of you to come to me!",""
"It's true, it's been a long time.",""
"How are you?",""
"You look great!",""
"Aww thank you, that's so kind of you to say!",""
"I don't feel so great though sadly.",""
"I am not as young as I used to be",""
"I feel like I'm starting to fall apart a bit",""
"Do you know what I mean?",""
"Oh, yes, I can see that.",""
"You could move in here, in that retirement home, wouldn't you?",""
"You think you'd like it?",""
"There's plenty of activities, and the staff is very nice.",""
"Especially Anya, she's my favorite.",""
"Oh yes, I met Anya on my way in, she did seem very nice",""
"Maybe I should look into it",""
"I still like having my independence though",""
"And my son Julian still helps out as much as he can",""
"Do you remember Julian?",""
"Of course, I still have my head, you know!",""
"But it must take her some time, to take care of you.",""
"And here, there's everything you need!",""
"You see movies, you participate in games, there's a library...",""
"And meals are pretty good.",""
"But you know me, I'm demanding on the kitchen!",""
"Oh yes, I remember that!",""
"You always were!",""
"What is your favourite meal that they make?",""
"Or should I say that you make them make!",""
"The duck jam with the cranberry jam.",""
"It's hard to cook the duck, especially when you make a lot of people for a lot of people, but here, the cook can do very well!",""
"Oh that does sound good, and quite fancy for a retirement home",""
"I had thought it would all be bowls of watery soup and dry crackers!",""
"And you know how much I like butter and cheese and rich, tasty foods",""
"Yes!",""
"My neighbor Roger only eats bowls of soup, that's true.",""
"But that's because he has no teeth, the poor old.",""
"I've got almost all my teeth, I'm lucky!",""
"Do you want to go to the common room for a cup of tea?",""
"I have always admired your full set of teeth",""
"Especially at our ages!",""
"What a good idea",""
"Let's go have some tea",""
"Beautiful.",""
"Plus, they have good cakes.",""
"And it's free!",""
"I mean, given what it costs me every month, luckily it's free.",""
"As soon as I get up, let's go!",""
"Haha, you crack me up!",""
"Don't put your back out getting out of the chair.",""
"I can give Anya a shout to get the hoist",""
"Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.",""
"It's been 15 minutes since I've seen her, I miss her!",""
"Oh wow you really do like Anya a lot!",""
"I think she might be a bit too young for you",""
"I'm allowed to dream, don't I?",""
"Plus I thought you had secretly always loved me...",""
"It's a secret!",""
"You're not supposed to know!",""
"But I have always known",""
"You have always been there, through my 5 previous failed marriages",""
"You were always there to pick up the pieces",""
"I always thought there would be more time",""
"And that our time together would come when we were still young enough to enjoy it",""
"If you move in here, we could live together!",""
"I always thought the idea of growing old together sounded romantic",""
"But the reality is bit less romantic - it's mostly deafness, forgetfulness, and aches and pains.",""
"But it would be nice to do experience those things with someone else",""
"We could try, my dear!",""
"Here's Anya.",""
"Let's go to tea!",""
"We could get cake!",""
"Lots of it!",""
"Are you going to invite a lot of people?",""
"Well, the thing is, the more people there are, the less cake there’ll be for us!",""
"That's not a very Christian idea!",""
"Unless we ask them to bring some with them.",""
"I know but it’s my party so I decide!",""
"Yeah, you could eat a cake all by yourself in your corner!",""
"Oh no, that’s not very fun!",""
"What do you suggest then?",""
"You have to invite a lot of people and prepare a lot of cake for the party to be good.",""
"By the way, I hope you didn't invite Robert.",""
"Oh... who should invite?",""
"I don’t have many friends except Robert...",""
"Ow!",""
"I'm warning you, it's Robert or me.",""
"Ok ok... then you can do the guest list.",""
"I’ll buy the decorations!",""
"I thought I'd invite Rachel, you know her.",""
"Ok, if you want.",""
"But only if she doesn’t bring her dog with her.",""
"I can’t stand the things!",""
"You know without her dog she won't come",""
"She's been so... weird since she's on the thesis.",""
"Ok but it’ll have to stay outside.",""
"I don’t want it messing up the new carpet!",""
"We'll put it on the balcony, hopefully it'll jump!",""
"That’s horrible!",""
"No more horrible than Rex",""
"Do you not have lots of pets at home?",""
"I thought you did...",""
"I had a Rottweiler, but I had to get rid of it, he ate my neighbor.",""
"So we ate the Rottweiler for my son's birthday",""
"Oh no!",""
"Was he not traumatised?",""
"Rottweiler?",""
"No your son!",""
"No, he asked for it again.",""
"It got me a little bit worried.",""
"Well he could come along tonight and deal with Rex!",""
"Take the basket.",""
"I'll grab the rabbit!",""
"You did say you liked rabbits, didn't you?",""
"I'll take the basket if it's full!",""
"Almost.",""
"But there's still some space for some more berries if you like.",""
"With pleasure, I like berries very much.",""
"More than rabbits!",""
"Oh, probably a good thing I couldn't catch it then.",""
"But we should probably be heading back soon.",""
"It's getting dark.",""
"Yes, it is.",""
"Especially since we don't have a tent to shelter us",""
"And it's getting a little cold.",""
"Do you want a scarf?",""
"I always bring several with me just in case.",""
"And a couple of hats.",""
"Ooh I even have some gloves!",""
"I'm not saying no for the scarf, because I'm really cold.",""
"Besides, I have a big cold, so I'd better cover for myself.",""
"You mean you need to wrap up warm?",""
"I'll warm myself with your scarf!",""
"Here you go!",""
"And I might even have some biscuits...",""
"Wait a sec",""
"No, sorry.",""
"There are none left.",""
"Great.",""
"Ah, too bad.",""
"But I think I see a Thermos in the back of the basket.",""
"Is it full?",""
"Is it hot?",""
"There's hot water in it!",""
"And I had tea bags!",""
"We can make a little tea to warm up!",""
"Ok then!",""
"And we could add some berries to give it some more flavour too!",""
"Sorry to bother you, but it's my first flight ever and I'm a little scared.",""
"Do you mind if we chat a bit during take-off?",""
"No, not at all!",""
"You're leaving for a holiday?",""
"My first ever abroad!",""
"And I've decided to go all by myself to get away from it all.",""
"Do you fly often?",""
"Every week.",""
"My company is bi-located.",""
"You'll see, it's very nice once we're up here.",""
"Do you really think so?",""
"I'm scared looking out of my second-floor window at home!",""
"I've never liked heights, and we're going to be very high up!",""
"The clouds, from above, it's like a sea of cotton.",""
"And the light is absolutely splendid.",""
"Besides, this is the safest way to transport it, as they say.",""
"I can't see the light.",""
"I've got my eyes closed.",""
"I don't like it.",""
"Everything's starting to move!",""
"They'll be stopping by with the drinks soon.",""
"You should ask for a glass of wine.",""
"You wouldn't mind paying for me, would you?",""
"I can't really find my purse with my eyes closed...",""
"I can see your bag.",""
"I'm just gonna take your credit card and pay for both of us and our next-door neighbor if you don't mind.",""
"What's the code for your credit card?",""
"No!",""
"Don't do that!",""
"That's another reason I don't like flying!",""
"You can never trust people in confined spaces!",""
"But why do you talk to me?",""
"I didn't have much choice, did I?",""
"But, whilst you're here, could you go get me a glass of water perhaps?",""
"That would be very nice of you.",""
"And I might just forget what you just said about my credit card.",""
"I'll get the stewardess out here.",""
"She'll bring you a glass of water.",""
"Just relax.",""
"Everything's gonna be okay,",""
"The plane, it's very safe.",""
"And there's always movies to change your mind.",""
"It's been a while since we've been in the air.",""
"We'll be there in five minutes.",""
"You almost finished your first flight!",""
"Thank you so much.",""
"And thank you for the chocolate bar I took out of your bag whilst you weren't looking.",""
"It was absolutely delicious.",""
"Flying isn't so bad!",""
"It was chocolate laxative!",""
"You haven't eaten it, have you?",""
"I think I'm gonna have to switch places...",""
"It's a shame I've got the aisle seat.",""
"You're going to struggle to past!",""
"Maybe I don't like flying after all...",""
"Well.... Good morning, Doctor.",""
"Good morning.",""
"How are you feeling today?",""
"Great--I did it!",""
"I left him!",""
"You finally split up with your friend?",""
"And how are you feeling?",""
"Free?",""
"Relieved?",""
"Maybe a little worried, too?",""
"My 'friend'--hah!",""
"He was my husband, but my friend?",""
"Not for years.",""
"You know, he thought I didn't know what him and Martin were doing when they said they were "playing handball"...",""
"He's young, but that doesn't excuse his selfishness.",""
"And most importantly, this relationship was hurting you.",""
"But you didn't answer me, how do you feel now, after leaving him?",""
"As I said in the beginning: great!",""
"You know, you don't really listen to me any more than he ever did... I think that's why I've always been so attached to you.",""
"Be careful, I'm only your psychiatrist!",""
"Oh, come on... You know that's not true.",""
"I know that",""
"What do you think you know exactly?",""
"I know that's not true.",""
"Frankly, the only he didn't know was HIM, and he would've, if he'd ever listened to me... Why do you think I did this??",""
"Why do you think I left him?",""
"It was so that WE could be together.",""
"Are you going to pretend that you haven't been doing what you've been doing these past three years that I've been in therapy with you?",""
"You're putting me in a difficult position.",""
"I'm your psychiatrist.",""
"When I listen to you and I talk to you, it's for your psychological balance, because it's my job.",""
"Have you just been playing with me all this time?",""
"PRETENDING to want to know how my day was, how I felt about things, what I was looking for in life?",""
"Playing with me... you... you...",""
"It's not a game, that's how therapy happens.",""
"Look, I think you should think about what you want from your psychiatrist.",""
"Maybe you should go to therapy with another psychiatrist.",""
"Because now I feel, in your mind, things are different from what they should be to make this happen.",""
"Hah--I've BEEN seeing another psychiatrist!",""
"You didn't even know it!",""
"You think you're so smart... playing with me all this time... I HATE you...",""
"I think we're going to end this meeting now.",""
"By the way, it's time for my next patient.",""
"Or rather, my next patient, by the way.",""
"Ohlala, I don't recognize this place at all.",""
"What about you?",""
"No not all, it looks very creepy!",""
"Very much so.",""
"Do you have a compass?",""
"We'll look on the map.",""
"No I dont have a compass or a map.",""
"I could try my phone - but there is no reception.",""
"Let's try going back the way we came",""
"I thought you were taking the compass...",""
"Does your phone have one?",""
"It's got GPS, it doesn't need a connection.",""
"I've got the map.",""
"No, you said you were taking the compass.",""
"And the map.",""
"We'll have to hurry, it's getting dark already",""
"Okay.",""
"Too bad.",""
"We'll do as you said and try to retrace our steps.",""
"I've got a flashlight.",""
"That's something...",""
"No, if you have the map we could see if there is a shorter route out of here.",""
"It will take us hours to get back the way we cme, in the dark, and through all that mud ...",""
"Sure, with the rain from this morning, the ground is very muddy.",""
"But without a compass it's hard to know which way to return even with the map.",""
"But since we're from the south, I think we'll get through this...",""
"If we head up the hill to out right, that must be eastards, you can see from the contours on the map.",""
"Then we may be able to see the road or the village from the top.",""
"Once we rach the road it will be easy.",""
"That's a great idea.",""
"Going up on that hill will give us the right visibility and the village will be lit up so we can spot him easily to go in the right direction.",""
"Let's go!",""
"According to the map there should be some rocks, a crag or a small cliff near the top of th hill.",""
"If we fing the rocks we shoyld be in the right place",""
"Is that a "Crag"?",""
"I don't know him.",""
"I'm not sure I want to throw up rocks.",""
"But okay, let's go.",""
"We're gonna make it.",""
"Yes Id say thats a crag.",""
"Unfortunately my typing is rather bad, I meant if we find the rocks not if we fling the rocks.",""
"I agree, throwing rocks around will get us nowhere.",""
"W need to saveour energy for the climb and the long walk down.",""
"Absolutely.",""
"Come on, let's move now, or we'll be here in a few days!",""
"So here we are at the edge of the cliff, and look there's the rod, and the village.",""
"Be careful, these rocks are rather slippery , don't want to fall ... aaaaaaaaaarghghghg",""
"Yes, you're right.",""
"Let's be careful.",""
"But anyway, it's nice we almost got to the village.",""
"You look a little worried, are you ok?",""
"Not so good.",""
"I don't like to fly at all on bad weather like today.",""
"Not so good, no.",""
"I don't like to fly at all on bad weather like today.",""
"It is difficult but you ve listened to all the instructions from the crew so you have done everything you can",""
"Would distraction help?",""
"Instructions from the crew don't help much when you're afraid of flying!",""
"They can't do anything about the turbulence!",""
"I know it is difficult for you as fear and logic don't always go hand in hand",""
"Would you like to play a card game to take your mind off it all",""
"Yes, actually the logic would want us to get in the head that the plane is the safest transport.",""
"I'll play a card game.",""
"That'll keep my mind occupied.",""
"What games do you like?",""
"Poker, pontoon!",""
"Whist?",""
"Or why don't you suggest something",""
"Ah, I'll play poker.",""
"It's the only game I know!",""
"But tell me, you don't seem very stressed.",""
"I ll get my cards out in a minute",""
"I fly quite often and just try not to think about the process too much",""
"I think the main thing is that it is difficult not to be completely in control",""
"It is similar to having an operation",""
"You just have to trust the anaesthetist",""
"Yes, I do.",""
"The upside with an operation is that you sleep during!",""
"Do you travel for your work or a tourist?",""
"After our game maybe we should both have a drink and try to sleep",""
"I ll get the cards now",""
"Maybe we should just sleep, bye for now",""
"Yes, a good glass of champagne will do me great.",""
"Come on, let's start the game.",""
"Emma, please let me worry about it, I want to rest.",""
"You're always resting.",""
"Let's go for a walk and climb that hill over there.",""
"That will give you something to rest for.",""
"I know, I know, and you're not holding up, you're not able to take time to think about it.",""
"Or even think of nothing.",""
"It's very nice, you should try",""
"I can't just lie by the pool.",""
"I've got the French disease of restless legs.",""
"All those French things, always being noticed.",""
"Don't you have a book or crossword puzzles?",""
"I can give you a comic book, I've brought a comic book.",""
"I don't like comics.",""
"I have a suggestion.",""
"If we go for the walk now I will lie quietly by the pool for 30 minutes afterwards.",""
"I won't say a word.",""
"I won't bother you at all.",""
"Are you kidding?",""
"We're gonna walk for an hour and a half and then we won't even have time to get back by the pool.",""
"It's time for drinks.",""
"You're really amazing.",""
"If you want us to walk tomorrow",""
"Yes I was pulling your leg.",""
"I will only stay quiet for 20 minutes.",""
"Do w have a deal?",""
"All right.",""
"And then, I promise, I'll be a nicer vacation companion.",""
"Oh thanks.",""
"I know I'm really amazing.",""
"I'll get the drinks.",""
"What would you like?",""
"I'll have an orange juice.",""
"I'm sorry to be such a party pooper, but I'm really tired.",""
"You deserve to put up with me.",""
"Ok I'll get the orange juices.",""
"Then I promise to leave you alone and we will go fot a shorter walk tomorrow.",""
"Shall we?",""
"I like the pool, but we're not gonna be here all afternoon!",""
"Don't you want to take a little hike?",""
"The mountains are beautiful here!",""
"You have a one track mind.",""
"Oh you mean go out?",""
"Yeah, yeah, we spent three hours at the pool.",""
"I'm getting a little bored, aren't you?",""
"I'm in heaven.",""
"I don't understand how you can be happy about doing nothing for hours.",""
"It's totally incomprehensible to me.",""
"I know.",""
"So you want to stay here again?",""
"They don't call you Einstein for ... No they don't call you Einstein at all.",""
"Do they?",""
"You go.",""
"Take pictures.",""
"Show me later.",""
"No no, I don't want to go alone, it's absurd.",""
"But once again, when you want to do different things, you end up doing whatever you want.",""
"Then we have a dilemma.",""
"It's always like that.",""
"I feel like you don't give a shit about my mind.",""
"It's hard, you know.",""
"Well now I can't relax knowing you're unhappy.",""
"What shall we do?",""
"How about a compromise?",""
"What do you suggest?",""
"We could walk up that mountain and ask the wise man of the woods what he thinks we should do.",""
"Who's the wise man of the woods?",""
"Well he probably doesn't exist but at least we would be up a mountain looking for him instead of having this stupid argument.",""
"Okay.",""
"Let's do this.",""
"Thank you for listening to me for once!",""
"Honey, it's your birthday in exactly two months, we have to throw a party, what do you think?",""
"Wow great idea.",""
"Shall we have it at home?",""
"If you want!",""
"How many people do you think we can invite?",""
"Well I would quite like an intimate gathering, just our close friends.",""
"Okay.",""
"But it's your turn to choose, it's your birthday, after all!",""
"Perhaps we could get some caterers in to do the food?",""
"Sure it's easier.",""
"But you know I like to cook, so I can also do one of the things if you want.",""
"Oh that would be lovely.",""
"Could you make me a fruit cake with icing decorations?",""
"Yes, of course!",""
"What kind of fruit do you prefer?",""
"Sultanas, raisins and dried apricots are my favourites.",""
"All right, I'll do that.",""
"I can make glassworks, too, if you want.",""
"It's convenient for the holidays.",""
"I would like to make it fancy dress too.",""
"We could have a theme like James Bond characters or pirates.",""
"What do you think?",""
"Sure.",""
"I like the idea of James Bond characters.",""
"It makes people look a little bit classy.",""
"I'll be Octopussy!",""
"You want me to be James?",""
"The problem is there may be several James!",""
"Of course, you'll be the best James ever!",""
"I don't look like him...",""
"Well, how about the drinks, what do you suggest?",""
"We could make sangria.",""
"And if the weather is nice we could hold it in the garden.",""
"Yes, that's a good idea!",""
"Sangria, and a punch.",""
"Now all we have to do is make the guest list and send out the invites.",""
"I'll get started on it.",""
"I've got most people in email so that would be the quickest way.",""
"Yeah.",""
"E-mails will do.",""
"This is exactly the vacation I wanted.",""
"A swimming pool, sun and nothing else.",""
"Nothing else?",""
"Really?",""
"Not even a trip into town?",""
"I forgot a good book.",""
"We could do some tourist shopping, or even go sightseeing!",""
"What do you think?",""
"The city, I see the rest of the year!",""
"But the city's the city.",""
"We're abroad!",""
"It's not the same thing.",""
"There'll be new architecture to see, statues, monuments, art galleries.",""
"You know - culture!",""
"Yeah, but it's nice every once in a while to land somewhere and relax.",""
"But we relax the rest of the year.",""
"You spend all day at home sunning in the garden.",""
"I really want to get out a bit.",""
"And those kids keep splashing me!",""
"What are you talking about?",""
"You can go if you want, and you come back for me",""
"They think it's really funny to spray water at me.",""
"I can't read when the pages are wet.",""
"I don't want to tire",""
"I'm not going anywhere!",""
"How about we put wheels on your sunbed and I push you around town on it.",""
"Would that be ok?",""
"It would be like a rickshaw!",""
"And what would I look like?",""
"Get me another pool in town.",""
"You could just lie back in the sun and relax!",""
"And we'd still get to go around town together!",""
"It's not fair.",""
"We always do what you want to do.",""
"We'll go into town tomorrow.",""
"But tomorrow never comes.",""
"Do you promise?",""
"Yes, I promise.",""
"Think about a program.",""
"Now can you put some sunscreen on, please?",""
"On you or me?",""
"Hello Lucien, how are you today?",""
"I'm old, and all my bones ache",""
"Did you talk to the nurses and the nursing home doctor?",""
"Maybe it's possible to offer something to ease your pain?",""
"I would prefer a large glass of wine thank you.",""
"I'm not sure the doctor's okay with it, but you can ask him.",""
"I came with cakes...",""
"Doctor will probably say 'no', so I'll just go aout and buy a bottle of cheap wine and hide it in my locker",""
"Maybe this will cheer you up...",""
"The cakes are a good idea.",""
"We can enjoy them with a glass or two of wine.",""
"If you want to buy a bottle of wine and drink it secretly, buy a nice bottle...!",""
"I also got your favorite jazz CDs.",""
"I still have money left from my birthday, so I'll make sure it's a good wine",""
"come over as soon as you can.",""
"We'll be really naughty, and smoke two of my small cigars as well.",""
"It's not a bad idea...",""
"But how could we not turn off the fire alarm with the smoke...",""
"Remember, the last time, she had declined...",""
"And the nurses were not happy because they thought there was a fire in the establishment...",""
"You will have to keep the wine and cigars a secret from the staff here.",""
"Yes, but with the smoke of the cigar, it's not very discreet...",""
"We will just have to go into the garden with two cigars two glasses and our bottle of wine",""
"I'll also have the cake for this makeshift drink.",""
"Why don't you bring a bottle as well, then we can get drunk, escape and go to a night club",""
"I thought you hurt all over?",""
"You want to go dancing?",""
"Nothing that a few glasses of wine and a visit to a night club wouldn't fix",""
"No offense, but with your walker and your false teeth, I'm not sure you're very popular with young women.",""
"When the young people get drunk, they won't care about my prostheses",""
"That's right.",""
"Your comment WAS offensive.",""
"You're forgetting your hearing aid and thick spectacles.",""
"You're nearly blind",""
"It wasn't offensive but realistic...",""
"But I agree with you...",""
"Me too, with my false teeth and my huge glasses, I'm not very attractive...",""
"The residential home's matron has arrived.",""
"She's taken my wine and cigars.",""
"I'm oof to bed.",""
"Find your own night club",""
"I think I hurt you...",""
"But remember... if we were young and beautiful... we are now old, but without losing our charm...",""
"Including false teeth, scope, and walker...",""
"I'm just irritable tonight, now my wine has been taken.",""
"I'm off to bed.",""
"Good night",""
"Please take a seat.",""
"You can put your coat on the hook over there.",""
"So, what brings you here today?",""
"Doctor, it's been several nights since I've been sleeping",""
"There's something I'm worried about.",""
"But I just can't figure out what",""
"Well, we could try to figure it out together!",""
"Just to be clear, do you mean you're struggling to sleep or that you're sleeping too much?",""
"I'm not sleeping.",""
"I'm trying to figure out what's on my mind.",""
"And if I get to sleep, I have strange dreams.",""
"What happens in these dreams of yours?",""
"Can you think of any possible link to your day-to-day life?",""
"Yes, it is possible.",""
"Or maybe not.",""
"Maybe it's an older thing.",""
"Can you perhaps describe your latest dream?",""
"Yes",""
"I'm in an aquarium",""
"Everything is dark around me",""

"I move easily between rocks and seaweed",""
"The aquarium is awesome, I can't see the windows",""
"The fish say hello",""
"Some people don't know me",""

"Do you know the fish too?",""
"Are they familiar to you?",""
"I don't know their names.",""
"Of all sizes",""
"I believe the grandfather of the little mermaid too",""
"You mean that he's there too?",""
"What is he doing in the aquarium?",""
"Yes, he is.",""
"He's cooking eggs on the plate.",""
"That's interesting?",""
"Are there chickens there too?",""
"This could be very interesting.",""
"Chickens?",""
"With eggs?",""
"Or fish eggs - you didn't say what kind they were.",""
"No.",""
"Huge eggs.",""
"Maybe this so you have some fish eggs.",""
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",""
"Maybe the eggs are from huge fish.",""
"Don't be.",""
"Don't worry.",""
"It's not your fault you have strange dreams. Perhaps you could draw your dreams.",""
"It might help to understand the emotions behind them, and produce a nice piece of artwork while you're at it!",""
"What the hell is going on?",""
"It's stopped between floors.",""
"I'll press the button to floor two again.",""
"Yeah, make it quick, I have a meeting in 15 minutes.",""
"Is it working?",""
"Ok OK.",""
"I've pressed it but we are still not moving.",""
"Is there an emergency button?",""

"There's really no one else we can count on in this building!",""
"I'm gonna have to complain to the technical service!",""
"It's a scandal!",""
"calm down, shouting won't help.",""
"We need to work out what to do.",""
"Perhaps there is a signal here.",""
"Have yo got you",""
"Have you got your phone with you?",""
"I'm not going to calm down!",""
"I have a conference call with the Tokyo office in less than 15 minutes.",""
"I can't miss it.",""
"The box depends on it.",""
"Your salary depends on it.",""
"Call for help!",""
"There's the big red button!",""
"In the name of God!",""
"Why is it my fault?",""
"If you paid me more I would press more buttons for help",""
"What if I sing you a song to calm you down?",""
"Right, I've pressed the big red button and nothing has happened.",""
"Well, my phone doesn't work in the damn metal box!",""
"You need to get a better phone",""
"No, you're not going to sing!",""
"I hate singers!",""
"My ex-husband was a singer.",""

"He seems to be doing well, though you know what happened with his wife last year, he's being very brave",""

"Hahaha, I don't need seminars to teach me!",""
"But I'm sorry, I'm going to have to leave you",""
"I must get home in time to prepare lunch or I'll get those fainting spells again",""
"But it's been lovely to see you!",""
"You must come visit me soon",""
"It was good to see you too!",""
"I hope I can come and see you soon.",""
"And I hope you get a respite from the arthritis!",""
"Ugh I'm fed up of nature.",""
"All it does is give me a blocked nose and insect bites.",""
"If you like nature it's hard to escape insect bites.",""
"But why the clogged nose, you're allergic to something: Flowers, trees...?",""
"I don't know.",""
"I appear to be allergic to most things these days.",""
"But nature just seems to keep following me everywhere!",""
"We'd have to do a desensitization test.",""
"Maybe you're allergic to animal hairs, too.",""
"But this doesn't tell us where we are.",""
"Do you have any idea where to go?",""
"No idea whatsoever.",""
"Just get us anywhere it doesn't itch anymore!",""
"We could try to find a pond, but I bet we'd get eaten alive by mosquitos.",""
"No, I don't think we should aim at the pond.",""
"We'd have to get out of the forest quickly.",""
"Why don't we scream?",""
"Or maybe we could just get back to ourselves?",""
"Do you have a loud voice?",""
"Or a megaphone that could help us?",""
"Yes, I could use my beautiful voice.",""
"I didn't think to take my megaphone.",""
"Sorry.",""
"I have a lot of water, though.",""
"Do you have your phone with you?",""
"Let's try Google Maps?",""
"Please let's not.",""
"I'm idealogically opposed to Google and any other institute trying to use us to get more data!",""
"We could just wander aimlessly and hope we find our way back.",""
"I have a vacuum cleaner that uses that very technique to clean the flat!",""
"You want us to straddle by snorting the ground?",""
"No, it's a joke.",""
"We should never have left the roads.",""
"Besides, I think that's what triggers an allergic reaction.",""
"Or these are the six little pistachio macaroons you took from the snack bar.",""
"What?",""
"You saw me take them?",""
"I thought I was being subtle...",""
"No, I saw the whole thing.",""
"Do you know how to direct yourself by the position of the sun?",""
"Not me.",""
"I may still pull out my phone and use Google, but if I've understood this is going to start a new allergy attack.!",""
"Ok, ok.",""
"You can use Google Maps...",""
"This is not good timing!",""
"An elevator failure is never the time!",""
"Let's flip the alarm.",""
"No don’t do that.",""
"I’d actually rather present my pitch directly to you.",""
"Really?",""
"What do you want us to do?",""
"Even if it's a bad time, it better be the elevator that goes down!",""
"Yes.",""
"I was going to suggest that you retired immediately.",""
"Please don’t take this the wrong way.",""
"I'm not taking this the wrong way, but I don't know how to pull out of an elevator down.",""
"You make and design elevators but this one breaks every day.",""
"It’s a disgrace.",""
"Our office is on the four hundredth floor and I have to take the stairs every day.",""
"That.",""
"That's no reason not to flip the alarm!",""
"I just thought you’d like the chance to defend yourself before going before the board of governors.",""
"Is it getting hot in here?",""
"I think you're very aggressive.",""
"Let's try to find a solution.",""
"Or do you want to take advantage of the situation to have a good time together and without aggression?",""
"What sort of good time did you have in mind?",""
"I have always had a thing for people in authority.",""
"Uh... it depends on you...",""
"I’m very open minded.",""
"Open-minded, perhaps, but in a very confined space.",""
"I'd prefer a stubborn spirit in an open space.",""
"An alcoholic spirit?",""
"Perhaps we could get a drink together?",""
"Well, I feel like there's a bar in the elevator.",""
"Oh yes, there is.",""
"Let’s get plastered.",""
"I don't know how we're gonna get out and the elevator and this dialogue that I prefer to end.",""
"Good luck with the meeting.",""
"That's it.",""
"The elevator's down again.",""
"I think you should, as a boss, do something to make these blackouts stop!",""
"I’m afraid there’s very little I can do.",""
"I’ve spoken to the council, but they just blame the weather.",""
"The masters, always the same.",""
"I don't think it's a matter of time.",""
"More money, don't you think?",""
"The system is so antiquated.",""
"It can’t cope with the heat.",""
"It would cost millions.",""
"That's just it.",""
"If the system is old and outdated, it's security issues for your employees, right?",""
"It deserves to spend millions of dollars to protect us.",""
"We are just a small business.",""
"I have very little leverage.",""
"Perhaps you could take a pay cut to help pay?",""
"Oh, my God, you're really something.",""
"It's up to us to pay for the repairs with our salaries!",""
"Amazing.",""
"You should start screaming with me to call 911.",""
"Calm down.",""
"All I’m asking for is half of your salary for the next twenty years.",""
"Otherwise you’ll have to use the stairs.",""
"No problem.",""
"I don't see any drawbacks to use the stairs.",""
"But you're gonna have to do the same, you guys, do the same thing.",""
"You look like you could do with using the stairs a bit more.",""
"I have many lazy employees.",""
"It's possible.",""
"There are also many of our leaders who are fat and skinny on borrowed stairs!",""
"I once won Mr Universe, I’ll have you know.",""
"I’m an adonis.",""
"Modest and proud of it, obviously.",""
"Ah, that's it.",""
"The door opens.",""
"Goodbye, you cheap bastard!",""
"Let's see if they prefer white or brown bread.",""
"Oh you took both?",""
"Great.",""
"I suggest we give this group some white, and brown to this other group.",""
"I heard that the bread was bad for the ducks.",""
"Now we can compare the efficiency of white bread and the black bread on these ducks.",""
"This is gonna be interesting.",""
"Yes, that is a conspiracy spread by firms that produce crackers and biscuits.",""
"They want to feed the ducks with crackers and cookies?",""
"It's stupid, it's too fat and too salty.",""
"And a lot of conservatives.",""
"At least the bread is healthy!",""
"It is empty calories, which makes the ducks fat and more likely to sink.",""
"It could make a lot of fat, though.",""
"Anyway, they seem to like two types of bread.",""
"Yes maybe some kale and broccoli would be better for them.",""
"Here, the little ducklings are coming in single file!",""
"I'm not even sure I know what the ducks are eating.",""
"Early in the season all of the mating pairs still have lots of ducklings.",""
"Yeah, it's kind of cute.",""
"I'm a little disappointed, at the moment they seem to digest the bread perfectly.",""
"The main challenge in feeding ducks lies in throwing the bread to different places so that even the smaller ducks get some too.",""
"Absolutely.",""
"But even among adults there seems to be dominant and dominant.",""
"Look at this one, every time he goes for the piece of bread to steal from his rightful recipient.",""
"Are we allowed to fish here?",""
"There's a fisherman there.",""
"Yes, the more aggressive ducks get more food and are better able to dominate the others.",""
"There are fishermen wading in the river as well but they need to watch out for snapping turtles.",""
"Are there turtles?",""
"I like turtles a lot!",""
"And swans are very aggressive this time of year.",""
"Everyone likes turtles!",""
"I hope so.",""
"I like their little alien heads and their wet skin of old men!",""
"The pigeons also come later and eat the bread crumbs that are dropped on the river bank.",""
"When I was little, I hated my cousin, in the country, who sometimes put turtles on her back.",""
"I thought it was totally mean and free.",""
"And I put them on their feet each time.",""
"And of course the hawks come for the pigeons.",""
"Yeah, it's the food chain.",""
"However, I doubt that the hawks are interested in turtles.",""
"Sometimes they are lucky and get a small dog or cat instead.",""
"That's for the day of the party!",""
"Well, the ducks are still here.",""
"They want more bread.",""
"Is there any left?",""
"Ducks are very patient creatures.",""
"Of course",""
"We throw them all that's left?",""
"There are always some crumbs at the bottom of the bag.",""
"I'm really tired today... so I say we stay by the pool!",""
"Oh come on.",""
"Do you really want to waste the entire holiday here?",""
"We might as well have gone to our local pool.",""
"Oh please can we do something else.",""
"A hike perhaps?",""
"Honestly, I'd rather stay with my mother in peace... you know very well she can't walk that much!",""
"Ok, fine.",""
"We can do something that your mother can do as well then.",""
"How about the beach?",""
"She can read her book under a parasol and we can build sand castles!",""
"Why not, but I'm still enjoying the pool.",""
"Don't you want to do some laps?",""
"Yeah, but it gets boring.",""
"I've already done a couple of hundred laps today.",""
"If I do any more I'm going to start going really barmy.",""
"And I keep bumping into people swimming slowly.",""
"A little drink by the bar perhaps?",""
"Or a lolly?",""
"Maybe later.",""
"I'll watch you do your laps.",""
"But I don't want to do laps.",""
"I want to build sand castles, eat lollies, go on a hike.",""
"Anything but stay by the pool.",""
"What do you usually do on holiday?",""
"I read, I rest, I go out for a drink on the terrace... and you?",""
"I build sand castles eat lollies and go for walks, as I said.",""
"Well, would you prefer to go to the bar to get a drink?",""
"In about an hour?",""
"Or I could get you something if you really want.",""
"I just don't like staying still.",""
"I'll pay if you like.",""
"Ah!",""
"Will you get us some drinks?",""
"Yes, anything to get away from this poolside for five minutes.",""
"What do you want?",""
"I'm pretty sure they have just about everything here.",""
"Get me a coffee, please!",""
"If you want, you can take a ride with the dog, too.",""
"It'll make him feel better, and it'll make him happy.",""
"True.",""
"He looks a bit bored too.",""
"One coffee coming up!",""
"Sugar?",""
"Milk...?",""
"A coffee with sugar, thank you.",""
"Ask my mother to get something for her too!",""
"Ok, one coffee, two vodka shots and a Martini coming up!",""
"I'll be back in a minute.",""
"I'm not sure those ducks will love our old bread",""
"It should soften quite quickly in the water.",""
"Although I do hear bread isn't very good for ducks.",""
"They like peas apparently.",""
"They don't like bread?",""
"What did you bring for them?",""
"Not peas anyway!",""
"I never thought about it.",""
"Peas and green vegetables are better for them.",""
"I think the bread sinks and creates a messy pond - so I hear anyway.",""
"There are signs up saying not to give them bread.",""
"I love coming here though as it's very peaceful.",""
"Watching the ducks is very soothing.",""
"Well, I'm not giving any more bread.",""
"Yes, I also like this pond with the ducks and the swans.",""
"Do you come here often to relax?",""
"I work from home, so it's nice to go out for a few hours otherwise I don't see anyone all day.",""
"What about you?",""
"I come here often to read.",""
"Look at the ducks, pretty girls too... what do you do for work?",""
"I'm a writer.",""
"I'm writing a book about cats at the moment.",""
"What do you do?",""
"On cats?",""
"I love animals, but I'm allergic to polite animals.",""
"Otherwise, I'm a jazz musician.",""
"Yes, I love all kinds of animals too, but as I live in an apartment, it would be cruel to own one as they wouldn't have access to the outdoors.",""
"Ah jazz musician.",""
"What instrument/s do you play?",""
"I play the saxophone.",""
"I think it's an instrument with a wonderful sound.",""
"Sometimes the trumpet.",""
"I have to go, but where do you play?",""
"Maybe I could come along to hear you play.",""
"I hope so.",""
"Give me your e-mail, I'll send you the ad for our next gig.",""
"Help!",""
"Help!",""
"I'm lost in the deep woods, I don't know what happened.",""
"What was the last thing you remember?",""
"How did we end up here?",""
"Don't worry, I've ended up here too.",""
"I was going to pick mushrooms in a corner that I know very well.",""
"I walked away a little bit... and when I turned around, I didn't recognize anything.",""
"And you?",""
"What have you done?",""
"I was smoking by my favourite tree and then all of a sudden I'm here with you.",""
"And my head's a bit funny.",""
"Did you eat any of those mushrooms?",""
"No!",""
"No!",""
"They're poisoned!",""
"I'm making a magic potion, but I'm not telling you what to do!",""
"Well I should hope not.",""
"Nobody tells me what to do.",""
"Although if you're making a magic potion, I have to say that I would be very interested in trying some.",""
"I might even have some ingredients you could add...",""
"Oh, yeah?",""
"Really?",""
"What ingredients?",""
"Because it's a recipe for ancient magic potion with a mystery ingredient...",""
"Well, I'll give you that ingredient... it's...",""
"From the Vache Who Rit!",""
"I'm sorry.",""
"Ok.",""
"I'm not sure I understand what you mean.",""
"It's either the bump on the head I got or you've been eating way too many mushrooms!",""
"What on earth is "the Vache Who Rit?"",""
"A little bit of both.",""
"The Vache Rit!",""
"... Laughing cow in English:",""
"A grilled cheese made in Vosges.",""
"You seem very knowledgeable about it.",""
"And does it have hallucinogenic effects then?",""
"Is that why it's so popular?",""
"Yes, that's exactly what it is!",""
"But there are still many ingredients in this potion.",""
"This morning it's gonna be intense!",""
"We need to start preparing for the wedding!",""
"OK.",""
"Tell me what you'd like me to do first.",""
"What's the menu?",""
"I think you can already start to realize the butterscotch, the pie maker has already prepared the cabbages.",""
"We have a plan:",""
"A puff of vegetables, walnut oil and roquefort.",""
"Then a monkfish with bacon and contacts.",""
"With white wine",""
"That sounds nice.",""
"Are we have canapes?",""
"And dessert.",""
"How many people is it for?",""
"Yes, it'll be for the cocktail.",""
"There's salmon, caviar, and foie gras.",""
"You mean how many guests?",""
"Yes",""
"I think they'll be a hundred and twenty.",""
"Right I'll get going.",""
"I'll see if we've had a delivery of the food.",""
"All right, I'll continue to make dessert at the time.",""
"The fois gras is missing.",""
"Can we substitute it with duck?",""
"What dessert are you making?",""
"No, you don't!",""
"Are you serious?",""
"Oh, my God.",""
"We can actually try to replace it with duck magret, I guess...",""
"Sorry.",""
"I'm trying to do my best.",""
"Oh, don't worry, it's not your fault!",""
"I wonder what could have happened, we may have been misled on the command...",""
"Ouch!",""
"I've cut myself.",""
"I think I need a plaster.",""
"But you cut your finger!",""
"We have to go to the emergency room!",""
"I'm afraid of blood, I'm going to faint",""
"Oh, my God, I don't feel well.",""
"I'm gonna throw up.",""
"The day isn't going so well.",""
"Let's cancel the wedding.",""
"I see you're resourceful.",""
"That's exactly what we're gonna do.",""
"You call the bride and groom?",""
"Fab!",""
"A trip to the beach it is!",""
"Hi, honey, how was your day?",""
"It was so awful I don't know where to start!",""
"Firstly, the car broke down",""
"and it was pouring with rain so I got wet running for the train.",""
"The train was full so I had to stand all the way in to town.",""
"So eventually I arrived late for work.",""
"My boss is not happy.",""
"I don't get it.",""
"You dropped out of our car to catch the train?",""
"And the train being full you went on foot?",""
"I understand you were late for work.",""
"Ah ok.",""
"The car broke down so I had to leave it at the side of the road.",""
"I had to go to work by train.",""
"There were no seats on the train, but I could stand up.",""
"Does that make sense?",""
"Anyway, how was your day?",""
"Well, no, honey, I don't understand what happened to you.",""
"Me, my day has been excellent.",""
"But how did you get home?",""
"You left the car at work?",""
"No, the car is at the garage being mended.",""
"I think it is going to be expensive to fix.",""
"I'm glad you had a good day.",""
"Well, apart from that little transport problem, how are your relations with your boss?",""
"That's still the main problem.",""
"Well he was fine about it once I'd explained what had happened.",""
"I have to make the time up tomorrow, so I'll be late home from work.",""
"We have tickets to go to the theatre tomorrow too!",""
"No!",""
"Your boss invites you to the theater?",""
"I'm not sure I agree.",""
"No, we have tickets darling, but it might mean we are a bit late as I have to work late.",""
"You and I are going to the theatre.",""
"Right.",""
"I'm hungry and it's now too late to cook.",""
"Shall we go out to dinner?",""
"I love the theater.",""
"Which play will be played?",""
"I'm hungry, too, we can go to the restaurant if you want.",""
"Wonderful!",""
"Let's go to dinner and chat more then.",""
"Hi!",""
"So, it's my birthday next week, and I'd like to throw a big party!",""
"Great!",""
"I love parties!",""
"What are you planning on doing?",""
"A big one or just a couple of friends?",""
"I'm not sure, but a big party with all my friends.",""
"At my place it's not big enough, can I rent a room or book a bar?",""
"You could, although you'll have to hurry before it's too late.",""
"I'll help you if you like.",""
"Thank you very much!",""
"It's probably too late to rent a room then.",""
"Do you know a nice bar nearby, and mostly big enough?",""
"Yeah sure.",""
"There's The King's Head.",""
"It's more of a pub than a bar, but you should be able to book a space.",""
"And the bartender's an idiot, so you could always hire him as a jester!",""
"Only kidding... but they do allow you to bring your own entertainment if you want.",""
"Thank you, that's great advice!",""
"I just called them, they said yes!",""
"So we have the back room, it's big enough, starting from 7: 00.",""
"So that's your alcohol sorted.",""
"What do you think about the entertainment idea?",""
"I know a man who knows a man who knows a busker, who might be able to come along and play a bit of guitar.",""
"I'd like to bring strippers in... do you think the bartender would accept?",""
"Ha ha ha!",""
"Seriously, you're right about the musicians.",""
"I have a friend who's in a music group, so I'm going to ask him to come out and play a little!",""
"Great!",""
"Are they any good?",""
"I can't think of anything worse than a rubbish band playing all night.",""
"No offense to your friend...",""
"Uh, they just started out, actually, they're a little beginner...",""
"Actually it's an experimental group, they combine a lot of music styles!",""
"They play the accordion, the banjo, the drum and the recorder!",""
"Do you think it might spoil the evening?",""
"Nah, should be alright.",""
"I'm a massive fan of the banjo, so it should be a blast!",""
"I'm really looking forward to it now!",""
"Thank God!",""
"Now all we have to do is send out the invitations.",""
"You'll be the first to receive the invitation, of course.",""
"Great!",""
"I'm gonna go and buy a brand new dress to wear!",""
"We absolutely need to go shopping!",""
"Excuse me, are you all right?",""
"No, I'm not.",""
"I'm on an aeroplane and I am very scared.",""
"Is this the first time you've been on a plane?",""
"No.",""
"I'm a frequent flyer.",""
"What about you?",""
"I take the plane too often.",""
"But you're still afraid of flying, though you're a regular?",""
"That's surprising!",""
"Did you have a bad experience?",""
"The person next to me was sick all over me and you yourself look rather ill.",""
"Oh, no, I'm fine, thank you.",""
"I have a rather pale complexion, that's all.",""
"You're the one who seems to be really stressed.",""
"Don't worry, everything's going to be fine.",""
"Are you sure?",""
"You look more green than pale.",""
"Really?",""
"If you're right, I hope it's nothing serious.",""
"Yes.",""
"But maybe it's the lighting in here.",""
"But if I start having problems of digestion, I have a simple solution:",""
"I'm also afraid of flight.",""
"It's not natural.",""
"Can I hold your hand please?",""
"Mind you, whiskey is perfect for stress, too.",""
"Uh... if you want.",""
"If I have any more alcohol I may be sick on you.",""
"Would you like a whiskey?",""
"No thank you.",""
"Just the hand please.",""
"All right.",""
"But I'm gonna get a whiskey, though.",""
"Now we've taken off, I'm going to get off.",""
"All the best.",""
"Oh, God, they only have Jack Daniels.",""
"Why don't they have Scottish whiskey?",""
"It's not the same thing!",""
"Oh yes, we've finally landed.",""
"All right, good day to you.",""
"Have a safe onward journey",""
"For tonight's meal, we're waiting for 10 people...",""
"I suggest we see to think together on the menu.",""
"Do you mean there are ten customers or are they late?",""
"There will be ten clients, who booked for tonight, at twenty o'clock.",""
"Oh I understand now!",""
"What shall we cook?",""
"That's the question.",""
"I understand there was a movie star...",""
"Are any of them vegetarian or even vegan?",""
"Then we must not disappoint them.",""
"Which movie star is coming?",""
"Do you think I could get them to autograph a napkin?",""
"Tom Hanks.",""
"I hear he's very nice.",""
"Maybe we can get an autograph at the end.",""
"I think my favourite film was Forrest Gump.",""
"And I don't think he's a vegetarian.",""
"Well when he was on that island in Castaway he must have eaten meat!",""
"We could schedule a carpaccio of saint chatter in the entrance.",""
"What do you mean?",""
"We're just going to get the scallops.",""
"We'll get the edible part, and cut it into thin slices.",""
"Perhaps we could use them as a starter and then do a meat dish.",""
"Then marinate in lemon juice.",""
"I think it can make a nice entrance.",""
"Yeah, it's a good idea to put on a meat plate!",""
"You got any ideas?",""
"What about roast breast of pigeon with beetroot, dauphine potatoes and a blackberry jus?",""
"You mean blackberries?",""
"Or a blackberry pie to finish?",""
"I mean a blackberry sauce to go with the pigeon.",""
"It's a good idea, original, which will probably enjoy our living.",""
"What about dessert?",""
"Maybe we could make a lemon pie?",""
"Or chocolate macaroons?",""
"I'm glad you like my ideas.",""
"I got them from watching Masterchef on television.",""
"Really?",""
"I like lemon pie.",""
"Perhaps with Chantilly cream?",""
"I watch that show, too!",""
"It's good to see you.",""
"It's been a long time and since I don't have a lot of visitors.",""
"Good to see you too !",""
"Sorry I haven’t visited in so long.",""

"Hawaii?",""
"Fabulous!",""
"What have you done?",""
"Sea-fishing, boat walks...?",""
"If not, yes, I made a few friends here with whom I speak music, literature, not to forget chess parts!",""
"We explored the volcanoes on the island , lay on the beach and enjoyed the glorious sunsets.",""
"I'd like to visit Hawaii.",""
"And where are you going to live now?",""
"Do you still have your math teacher position?",""
"I’m thinking to live in Hawaii for the rest of my life it was a life - changing experience.",""
"I was really moved by the hula dancing, and have become pretty good at it.",""
"For now I am living with my brother , I want to quit math teaching and dance full time",""
"Going from teaching of mathematics to dance is original!",""
"But you told me you went on a honeymoon!",""
"What does your husband do?",""
"Yes my honeymoon has changed my life",""
"He’s a scuba diver camera man .",""
"So He would also love to move there",""
"It was lovely seeing you again",""

"Hey, how was your day?",""
"Hey, I had a terrible day at the office.",""
"Tell me.",""
"What happened?",""
"I accidentally transferred â¬1 billion to the wrong customer account!",""
"My boss was so angry with me.",""
"She told me that if we cannot get the money back then I'll need to find the 1 billion euros myself.",""
"Isn't there another way?",""
"No way!",""
"I don't know.",""
"If we cannot get the money back, can you give me 1 billion euros to pay back to the company?",""
"But we don't have it!",""
"Isn't it possible to get a lawyer?",""
"Yes, I think you're right.",""
"We should get a lawyer and explain that this was a mistake.",""
"But if the lawyer can't help us then maybe we should ask a sorcerer to help us to cast a spell on my boss.",""
"Do you know any good sorcerers?",""
"Not in particular.",""
"But we'll probably find some in the forest",""
"I don't like going into the woods.",""
"Could you go for me and find the best sorcerer for less than 1 billion euros?",""
"Are you stupid?",""
"Pay even more?",""
"What if it doesn't work?",""
"I said for less than 1 billion euros not more than 1 billion euros.",""
"Where will I get a billion euros?",""
"My parents won't lend me that kind of money.",""
"OK then we will need to steal the money from the bank.",""
"I'm going to bed.",""
"We'll think about it tomorrow.",""
"OK, I'm sorry for all the stress that my awful day has caused.",""

"But, I don't think it's working right now.",""
"No I am thinking of ditching it.",""
"I have some plans of my own.",""
"Maybe we should knock on doors and make noise?",""
"What do you think?",""
"Absolutely!",""
"Great idea!",""
"Let’s stamp our feet and shout loudly.",""
"I hear noise.",""
"I think the co-workers called 911.",""
"In the meantime, we could talk about our future plans.",""
"What do you think?",""
"Thank goodness for that!",""
"Where will you go when we finally get out of here?",""
"I have precisely the plans I have to show you tomorrow.",""
"Do you wish to see them?",""
"After the elevator, I have to go to my office to print new cards.",""
"What about you, boss?",""
"I have my very important meeting to attend if they can rescue us soon!",""
"I hear people outside!",""
"Yes, deliverance should be here any minute.",""
"Who are you receiving?",""
"What do you mean?",""
"This afternoon, who do you have an appointment with?",""
"I am meetin with the chairman.",""
"I think he wants to talk about my promotion.",""
"Great!",""
"Good date.",""
"We're blocked.",""
"And I was supposed to go to an important meeting!",""
"At least that means that somebody might wonder where you are and come looking",""
"This liftoften breaks and the alarm bell does not work",""
"Hopefully, we'll soon find out there's something unusual going on.",""
"And yourself, what department do you work for?",""
"I work in the trading department, mostly for crude oil",""
"Ocassionally we will trade products too",""
"You make the market for what kind of oil.",""
"And why do you want to exchange our products?",""
"You have to sell them instead!",""
"I meant crude oil products, gasoline, lpg",""
"Also when we have surplus we will sell to someone else directly or exchange for a more timely delivery",""
"It is a strange business",""
"I am started GN to get claustrophobic",""
"Sorry I am starting to get claustrophobic",""
"It's normal to have a little stress in a volume as small as the elevator.",""
"Take a deep breath and you'll feel better.",""
"The paramedics will be here any minute.",""
"I hope so, it is getting worse",""
"I was stuck in a lift for four hours when I was a child",""
"Oh, yes, I understand.",""
"Childhood memories always remain in memory, especially if they're unpleasant!",""
"I am starting to sweat as I remember",""
"I hope they won't be long finding us",""
"Last time I was on my own",""
"My parents just thought I had gone off in a strop",""
"Living this kind of experience alone, especially child, is not very pleasant.",""
"But I hear noises.",""
"Courage, help is coming!",""
"Thank goodness.",""
"Hey, Caroline, don't you get bored a bit here?",""
"I'm ok actually.",""
"I'm just enjoying the beautiful weather and the calm breeze.",""
"What else could you ask for?",""
"I'd like to go for a walk for a change.",""
"But aren't you tired?",""
"We had a huge lunch...",""
"Exactly, the boardwalk's good for the digestion!",""
"I find that sleeping can be quite efficient too!",""
"Why are you so keen to go for a walk?",""
"Doing laps in a small pool, that's not very original.",""
"While there's a little forest road right next to it.",""
"I wouldn't mind if you brought me back something cool to drink.",""
"But I quite like being here thanks.",""
"It's too shady in the forest for my liking.",""
"Then I'll leave you and I'll meet you at the end of the afternoon.",""
"Hi!",""
"Wait!",""
"Will you get me something from the shop round the corner?",""
"Pretty please!",""
"Oh, hello, Leontine, how are you?",""
"You look well!",""
"Hello Alice.",""
"Thank you for coming to see me.",""
"I am doing well other than my sore back.",""
"Please, it's always nice to see you, you know.",""
"Bad back!",""
"I read that it's bad for the century, but I wish it didn't last a century!",""
"That's very kind.",""
"How was your journey?",""
"No sweat.",""
"Are you still okay here?",""
"I hope it settles soon as it keeps me awake sometimes.",""
"I am quite happy here and the staff are friendly but Sometimes I don't like the food.",""
"I understand your back and I'm sorry!",""
"I hope it calms down quickly.",""
"The staff seems very pleasant indeed.",""
"I saw your brother yesterday!",""
"AS long as I keep moving it should get better.Thank you.",""
"Oh where did you see my brother?",""
"We met on the street, it was fun!",""
"He was talking to a friend while walking his dog.",""
"Did he give you any messages for me?",""
"He asked me to say hello and tell you he'll be by Tuesday if he can.",""
"That's good news .",""
"I really look forward to his visits.",""
"How far do you live from him?",""
"Yes.",""
"He must have been near his friend's house.",""
"I didn't ask him for details, you know how your brother likes to be discreet about his life.",""
"THe last he came to visit he brought me some delicious chocolates.",""
"I am looking forward to hearing about his trip to France.",""
"Good evening.",""
"What would you like?",""
"I'll have a caipirinha.",""
"With a few olives and sausage rings if possible.",""
"Certainly, sir.",""
"One caipirinha coming up.",""
"Here you are, and your olives, but I'm sorry we don't have any sausage rings.",""
"You don't have a sausage?",""
"It's okay.",""
"I'm surprised you know the caipirinha.",""
"This is not a very common aperitif in Europe.",""
"Where did you learn to do that?",""
"I have been a bartender for a few years and I've worked in a lot of different places.",""
"I also did some training while working in a famous bar in London.",""
"Awesome!",""
"It's a hell of a experience.",""
"Which country did you go to?",""
"What's your favorite aperitif?",""
"I've spent time in France, Germany and South America.",""
"I don't have a favourite aperitif myself - I don't drink much at all, really only at special occasions where I like a glass of champagne.",""
"Yes, a glass of champagne is always, everywhere, an excellent aperitif.",""
"You've traveled a lot!",""
"Which country did you enjoy the most?",""
"South America was really interesting, different from home.",""
"I did some travelling and there was so much to see.",""
"Yes, a lot to see in South America.",""
"Have you been able to go to Argentina, or see the ruins?",""
"Which ruins?",""
"There were a few.",""
"I hope you still could have gone to Machu Picchu.",""
"You bring back memories of these South American countries?",""
"So you've been there yourself?",""
"I sure.",""
"And in Mexico City.",""
"I brought in some very beautiful stones.",""
"Are you interested in mineralogy?",""
"I've met some gold-diggers in my time, but other than that, it's not something I know anything about.",""
"Good evening.",""
"So how was your day?",""
"My day SUCKED.",""
"How was yours?",""
"Mine was fine.",""
"As scheduled.",""
"But you had a difficult meeting in perspective...",""
"The main problem was that I couldn't find a place to eat.",""
"I was starved, and you know how "hangry" I get... I walked around for, like, an hour.",""
"One place after the other was closed, closed, CLOSED.",""
"But, tell me about your day.",""
"Being a little hangry is not like starving to death in Syria... We have to be aware of what the REAL problems are--and aren't.",""
"You mean after your meeting, you tried to isolate yourself to eat but couldn't find a quiet room?",""
"Bad luck.",""
"I know when you need calm, you really need to calm down!",""
"True, true.",""
"How was YOUR day?",""
"My day has been quiet.",""
"A good productive meeting this morning and this afternoon I was able to finish my report.",""
"Have you managed to calm down for lunch?",""
"Other than that, my day was actually pretty good... I spent most of the day writing something that I wanted to work on.",""
"Ah.",""
"That's good.",""
"And what did you write about?",""
"Lunch was fine.",""
"I had a bowl of chirashi--yum!",""
"I wrote about ... hm, what did I write about--I'm getting too old to remember ANYTHING... I wrote about the kinds of information that needs to be recorded in order to repeat and to interpret an experiment.",""
"How about you--what was your meeting about, and what was your report about?",""
"Who was at the meeting, and did everyone behave themselves?",""
"What's a bowl of chirashi-yum?",""
"I've never had it.",""
"The meeting was pretty good.",""
"There must be some trouble.",""
"It's a bit heavy to wear.",""
"But we made it.",""
"That's good.",""
"Anything interesting on the news?",""
"No more than that.",""
"You know that takes time these things.",""
"What about your side?",""
"The usual criminals in the White House.",""
"Trump being an asshole.",""
"Trump being an idiot.",""
"Same ol', same ol'.",""
"OK, I must run out to the store and pick up some coffee.",""
"I'll be back soon--do you want me to pick up anything?",""
"But who's an asshole?",""
"The president of the Us?",""
"Yes--by definition.",""
"You should read the book "Assholes: A Theory." It's a philosopher's take on what, exactly, an asshole is, and why they are as they are, and why they so infuriate us.",""
"It was written in 2010--in other words, long before the current hell--and he talks about Trump at some length!",""
"OK, I'm outta here.",""
"Back in a bit.",""
"Why do we learn about History?",""
"But mademoiselle, history is a very important discipline.",""
"It allows you to understand the present and prepare the future as a student of the past.",""
"And then it's part of the general culture of all educated people.",""
"Not knowing the story is come from nowhere and be lost in the present.",""
"Why does school not teach us more about the negatives of debt and looking after our mental health?",""
"Every teacher specializes in discipline.",""
"I agree with you that certain subjects are not treated enough.",""
"But the story is very important.",""
"It's also in the story that we understand what democracy is, politics, the cultural identity of his country.",""
"And it doesn't fascinate you, ancient civilizations?",""
"The birth of writing?",""
"Yes I suppose it is very interesting, but it does not feel very relevant to the present",""
"Yes, it is, because the story often repeats itself.",""
"Studying the consequences of decisions that were taken in the past allows you to understand what the right decisions to make today!",""
"Let's take an example.",""
"After the first world war, the winners have decided to ask for some very high repairs in Germany.",""
"It meant a fortune.",""
"It ruined the German economy, and drove indirectly into World War II.",""
"After the second world war, the winners understood because of what it was that we didn't have to make the same mistake again.",""
"And they built Europe instead.",""
"And now we've lived in peace for 70 years in Europe.",""
"That is true.",""
"Do you think that one day in the future children will not need to learn to write with a pen and just use a computer instead?",""
"I don't think so.",""
"You'll always have to be able to write letters, sign documents...",""
"But what are you interested in?",""
"What are the subjects that seem useful to you?",""
"I am very passionate about looking after the planet",""
"And making sure that we look after it",""
"by recycling, being mindful of the ocean and finding new sources of energy",""
"Yes, they're very important subjects, you're right.",""
"Are you planning to study in this field?",""
"I would like to study more about the planet and how we can change our behaviour for the better",""
"But I also really enjoy reading and theatre",""
"You might want to start looking into which schools there are cursus that might interest you.",""
"But the environment is a very exciting and very important discipline for our future, so I encourage you in this path!",""
"Do I need a University Degree to get a job working to change the environment?",""
"Depends on what you want to do.",""
"We don't need a college degree to change his behavior daily, and to encourage people to do the same.",""
"But if you want to go further, for example in research or engineering, then you'll need skills and degrees that only higher studies can give you.",""
"If we all used computers at school it would be better for the planet!",""
"How about iPads instead of paper note books?",""
"I think my fellow students would be very happy",""
"You should look into it, because producing computers and iPads are very polluted.",""
"While paper can be produced in a way-in-the-way environment, replanting the trees.",""
"Why is producing computers and iPads very polluting?",""
"Because today, we don't know how to produce them without polluting.",""
"Electronic devices contain many toxic chemicals, for example, in the batteries, the monitors, the chips.",""
"I think about the semi-drivers, who are almost exclusively products in China, in very polluted mines.",""
"But you can talk to your physics teacher, if you're interested.",""
"I have to leave now, because the next class starts in one minute!",""
"See you next week!",""
"Thank you!",""
"Could you please wash your hands after touching your face",""
"It is vital that we maintain good hygiene",""
"You're right.",""
"I'll wash my hands right now!",""
"What do you want us to do next for tonight's menu?",""
"Great, I am pleased we have cleared the ground rules",""
"What is on the menu for tonight, do you remember?",""
"It seems to me that we should be planning an entrance with fish.",""
"Then a dish with meat, and then dessert with red fruit.",""
"Your are very good at inventing special dishes with fresh produce",""
"What shall we do with the bream?",""
"It is lovely and fresh, something simple I suggest that won't detract from the flavour",""
"What exactly do you mean, "Bram," I'm not sure I understand.",""
"Bream is a small white fish, slightly like sea bass I guess",""
"Thank you for your precision.",""
"Maybe we can marinate it in lemon, and with a little olive oil?",""
"In order to serve him in the entrance, along with some fresh vegetables?",""
"I think if you fillet it, then fry it lightly and serve with a lemon and olive oil emulsion",""
"I think we could just prepare it and serve with a little seaweed as it is a starter",""
"Oh, yeah, that's a great idea!",""
"The algae will bring a small side, and it's original!",""
"There are plenty of fresh strawberries, perhaps you could start by mascerating them in sugar and some liqueur",""
"If you get those started",""
"Of course.",""
"What do you think of the healthy eating initiative that the Government are getting involved in?",""
"Maybe we could make a little lemon pie with the strawberries?",""
"Obesity in France is not such a problem as it is in England",""
"Do you think I am right about that?",""
"The object became a global problem.",""
"But with good stuff, you can make you want to eat better.",""
"Bearing that in mind I think we should leave the lemon pies and concentrate on a lighter menu",""
"You're right.",""
"Thanks for your suggestions today, good bye",""
"Excuse me.",""
"I'm trying to have a relaxing time here and I'd prefer not to be disturbed.",""
"Thank you.",""
"Okay.",""
"But it's already over an hour ago that we're here.",""
"We could go to town for a while.",""
"I've seen the town and I'm not impressed.",""
"I'd much rather just laze here in the sun and perhaps read a chapter or two of my book.",""
"I'm really getting into the story and I think it's going to become quite exciting soon.",""
"Okay, suit yourself.",""
"What is this exciting book you're reading?",""
"A detective novel?",""
"It's a kind of detective novel.",""
"The main character is a genealogist and he is trying to make sense of a family story about smugglers and a cache of gold sovereigns.",""
"That sounds like a curious story to me.",""
"I'm gonna go get my science fiction book.",""
"That's better.",""
"Would you like a drink?",""
"Gosh!",""
"I thought you weren't going to ask.",""
"I'd love an Aperol spritz.",""
"Just as a matter of interest; why is a science fiction book better?",""
"I find many of then just too far fetched to be believable.",""
"I suppose it takes all sorts to make the world!",""
"Because the history of the first men who come to Mars and find traces of a very old civilisation, it's much more interesting than your history of genealogist and treasure!",""
"As I said; it takes all sorts.",""
"My book is partly based on fact.",""
"It imagines things that might have happened to a real smuggling gang and incorporates some recent discoveries of a couple of walled-up skeletons.",""
"As far as I understand it, there is very little likelihood of an old civilisation occurring on Mars - at least not a form of life we'd recognise - there's a poor atmosphere and little water.",""
"The probability of finding ruins on Mars is indeed small.",""
"I'll give you that.",""
"That says I don't hate crime novels.",""
"Agatha Christie's for example.",""
"Have you read it?",""
"I have read some of Agatha Christie's novels.",""
"I'm not a great fan because they are rather formulaic.",""
"What I do find fascinating about her is the question of what she did when she disappeared and some people thought that she had committed suicide.",""
"Well, I'll give you 15 more minutes with your genealogist.",""
"Then we'll go to lunch.",""
"Good morning!",""
"You've seen all those ducks!",""
"I see you feed them, too... what is it?",""
"They're mallards and coots.",""
"They really like eating frozen peas",""
"But you defrost them before, right?",""
"Do they like other things?",""
"Yes, it's better to defrost them first.",""
"I think they like vegetation, but I'm not too sure what else",""
"Do you know if there is a cafe close by to here?",""
"Wait...",""
"But it's not close and I don't know if it's open on Sunday.",""
"We have to go a little longer along the pond and then roll up the river for a hundred yards.",""
"Then there's this round-point and you won't be able to miss it.",""
"I recommend the fish and chips.",""
"Even though I think their peas are frozen as well!",""
"Ah, okay.",""
"Do you know what it's called.",""
"Haha!",""
"I like fish and chips - it's a very English dish!",""
"Duck with orange sauce is a favourite of mine too.",""
"What's your favourite dish?",""
"I think it's called "The King of the pond," but I'm not sure.",""
"I like fish and chips a lot, but I don't eat much meat.",""
"I prefer vegetables and fish / shellfish.",""
"Ducks - I prefer them in the pond than on my plate!",""
"So you're a pescatorian?",""
"Ah ah ah... in a way yes!",""
"But now that I think about it, I think that coffee makes orange duck as well.",""
"I don't know if it's any good, you should try it!",""
"Okay I will.",""
"Are you a good cook?",""
"All this talk of food is making me hungry",""
"Yes, I understand!",""
"See you!",""
"Good evening!",""
"What do you have on the pressure?",""
"On the pressure?",""
"i don't follow.",""
"I am pretty stressed out with work at the moment.",""
"is that what you mean?",""
"No, I just wanted to ask what the beers you have on the shooter.",""
"If you have wine, I'll be fine, too.",""
"oh!",""
"sorry!",""
"we have some craft beer from West Virginia that's is quite bitter but very refreshing",""
"i wouldn't recommend the wine because we only have cask wine and it is failry awful",""
"after all, we are beer specialists",""
"Perfect!",""
"I like a lot of bitter beer.",""
"Could you pour me a pint?",""
"if you like a lot of bitter beer, may i suggest going for the full stein of Löwenbrau.",""
"a whole litre of a very drinkable beer",""
"granted, some may see it as being a rather comercial beer, but it is still a solid choice",""
"Then I'll have a whole liter!",""
"Thank you!",""
"What do you have to eat?",""
"remember, drink responsibly.",""
"to eat?",""
"let me see",""
"you're going to need something hearty to soak up all that beer",""
"it looks like you going to be having quite a big night tonight",""
"I'm still in charge!",""
"I'll take a cab.",""
"how about our burger platter.",""
"sound good?",""
"Perfect!",""
"a selection of 30 miniature burgers, each with it's own unique cheese and meat combo",""
"But I don't like onions.",""
"Do you have a burger without onions?",""
"I don't want to be difficult.",""
"we can do all of our burgers without onions if you prefer",""
"30 burger platter, hold the onions.",""
"i'll put the order through",""
"as we say, the customer is always right.",""
"Put on a lot of cheese, especially!",""
"I'm gonna need a lot of beer to pass all those burgers.",""
"Bring me another one soon.",""
"Good morning, Doctor.",""
"Good morning.",""
"Now, tell me.",""
"What's been going on?",""
"I need to talk to you.",""
"Can I sit in this chair?",""
"No, that's mine.",""
"But you can sit anywhere else.",""
"Or if you prefer, you can lie down there.",""
"Some people prefer that.",""
"Can I lie on this couch?",""
"Are you sure?",""
"I don't want to bother, he looks clean and new, I'm kind of worried about sitting on it.",""
"I don't want to ruin it.",""
"I think it would make me feel better to stand.",""
"Would you like me to take my shoes off?",""
"Notice how bad my feet feel, I don't know too much what would be best.",""
"Calm down, please.",""
"Please don't worry.",""
"Aren't you hot?",""
"Please just make yourself at home.",""
"But there's no need to panic.",""
"So, if you're feeling comfortable, what's been going on?",""
"I think my neighbors think I want to hurt them.",""
"So I'm afraid to stay at home and try to make the least noise.",""
"But it's tiring.",""
"I don't belong anywhere, you know.",""
"I'm sure there's somewhere you fit in.",""
"Have you always felt like this?",""
"I don't know.",""
"But I think it's getting harder for me in time.",""
"Plus, my new neighbors are weird.",""
"They always look at me with a strange look.",""
"I think they're listening to what I'm doing through the walls.",""
"Do you listen to them through the walls too?",""
"Oh, no, I'd be too afraid if they found out I was listening.",""
"But I still hear them.",""
"The walls aren't that thick.",""
"That's why I feel like I'm watching.",""
"But I don't have the money to move into a house.",""
"Oh, so you live in a flat at the moment?",""
"Yes, I did, didn't I tell you earlier?",""
"I'm sorry.",""
"Maybe you did.",""
"No worries.",""
"But you never had problems with the old neighbours then?",""
"She was an old person who didn't hear anything and make no noise.",""
"I didn't feel at home.",""
"Well, that will give us a good basis to start with next time.",""
"I'm afraid our time is up for today.",""
"I've got lots of other patients to see.",""
"And a blind date this lunchtime!",""
"Please sign out at reception when you leave.",""
"Okay, thanks for your time, I'm sorry I bothered you.",""
"And I'm sorry I'm always sorry...",""
"I'm sorry.",""
"Good morning, ma'am.",""
"I'm having a hard time understanding the odds.",""
"It's too complicated for me that's done only literature so far!",""
"Help me, please!",""
"Well, I am an English teacher, so I'm not sure I'll be much help...",""
"Do you not like Mr Jameson?",""
"He's your maths teacher, right?",""
"I would understand - he can sometimes come across as a bit intimidating.",""
"Start by telling me what you understand.",""
"I know you're an English teacher, but Mr. Jameson is a bully!",""
"All he does is put us down, and remind us that he's intellectually superior.",""
"I can't take it anymore, and I'm not the only one.",""
"Besides, he keeps harassing my friends.",""
"Oh dear.",""
"Maybe we need to have a proper discussion about that at some point.",""
"Have you contacted anybody about that?",""
"There is a school counsellor on site every Tuesday.",""
"That's the thing.",""
"They're plotting together in order not to let any of the information escape.",""
"Just talking to you puts me in grave danger.",""
"I really didn't know it was this serious.",""
"Don't worry, we'll do something about it.",""
"And never be too scared to talk out about it.",""
"How long has it been going on?",""
"It's been going on since we dared to tell him his course was going too fast.",""
"He's got too much ego and can't stand a contradiction.",""
"Since he's friends with the councilman, he's getting revenge.",""
"However, now that he's aware of his power, he also goes after my friends because they're girls.",""
"Now they hate me because they think it's my fault.",""
"Oh dear.",""
"This really does sound serious.",""
"I'm going to have to organise a meeting to discuss this.",""
"This needs to be sorted out quickly.",""
"I'll talk to the head and see what we can do to investigate, and I'll let you know.",""
"And don't worry, I'll do it quickly!",""
"Thank you so much!",""
"I hope he can rot in jail for the rest of his life, eaten by rats.",""
"So Germaine, how are you today?",""
"So, so, but much better than yesterday, thank you.",""
"How are you?",""
"How are those lovely grandchildren of yours?",""
"Three is it now or am I miscounting!",""
"Oh, good!",""
"It's just all these little pains, it doesn't make life easy!",""
"My grandkids are fine, the last one, Marion's daughter my second daughter, you know, just made her first steps!",""
"As a parent you're not supposed to have favourites, but Marion has been such a lovely daughter.",""
"I'm guessing her child is just as beautiful as she is.",""
"Did you bring in any photographs?",""
"Pains, don't talk to me about pains.",""
"I can barely walk these days",""
"Ah, how I understand you!",""
"It's true that Marion was always the little girl of everyone... kind of like your Oliver, wasn't she?",""
"I don't have any pictures with me, you know, the technology and I... my kids gave me a tablet, but I don't know what to do with it!",""
"For your arthritis, fortunately, you're here, right?",""
"The staff seems very caring.",""
"Oliver gave me a tablet my birthday.",""
"I use it for watching TV and reading books.",""
"He showed me how it works, but if I get stuck the girls in here will always help me.",""
"They are very kind.",""
"Ah, you must be cleverer than me then!",""
"My children often show me how to turn it on and even how to write e-mails, but...",""
"With my poor head, it's too difficult!",""
"Young people go so fast!",""
"Everything has to go fast for them...",""
"Oliver spent ages showing how to switch it on, charge it up, how to send emails.",""
"Watching YouTube, listening to the radio, they're easy.",""
"I have to get someone to download the books for me.",""
"You should really try it - you can set the font size so it's much easier for our old eyes to read the print.",""
"Well, if you say so, I'll hold on!",""
"Still, we live in crazy, crazy times!",""
"It's all happening so fast!",""
"At last!",""
"My dear Germaine, I'm going to have to leave you, I have an appointment at the rheumatologist at 3: 00!",""
"By the time we get there... as always, it's been a pleasure to see you.",""
"Good luck and do come and visit me again soon.",""
"Next time, though, bring those photographs, oh, and if you can carry them some grapes, a box of milk chocolates and the Sunday newspapers.",""
"Love to the family x",""
"go on, tell me what happened.",""
"why do you look so down in the dumps?",""
"I was fine until you saw your head.",""
"I can't stand you anymore",""
"wow.",""
"i was not expecting that.",""
"what did I do?",""

"Actually, I'd like that.",""
"It's turning into a hell of a party!",""
"Great!",""
"What time do you want me to come over?",""
"Well, if we could have a date two hours before, it wouldn't be bad.",""

"Balloons, yes, why not!",""
"Weather changes every day, it's hard to predict... Sinon, so I also ordered a barrel of beer so I could get some pressure.",""
"People always like that.",""
"But I could really use some help wearing it and set it up...",""
"Have you been drinking already?",""
"A barrel of beer would be great.",""
"There are a few sailors coming along and they love barrelled beer!",""
"Shall I bring some red or white wine?",""
"Or both?",""
"Both!",""
"If there are sailors, there's gonna be a wide range on the drinks.",""
"Do you think we're gonna need rum?",""
"Rum is a must for sailors.",""
"We don't want to upset them and cause a mutiny.",""
"I love sailors...",""
"No!",""
"But we're gonna have to blackmail them.",""
"Are they in the merchant navy, or are there some pirates?",""

"Though I wouldn't mind some of the good rum.",""
"Okay for a massage and a rum.",""
"And what did your boss say?",""
"He was mad at you?",""
"After he'd finished flapping his arms around, he did say something not particularly nice - something about his new shirt.",""
"Well he couldn't really have fired for me that.",""
"But he did have a bit of a go - and in front of the entire office!",""
"It's okay, with everything he wins, he'll buy another one!",""

"Yes, eating something with mineral water is a good idea.",""
"Here's the menu.",""
"Let me try a malt whiskey this time with an ice cube.",""
"Now, what shall I eat?",""
"Can I have a sirloin steak with french fries and a side salad?",""
"Sorry, we don't serve this dish till noon.",""
"And I suggest you only take the ice cube without the whiskey.",""
"Why, have you run out of whiskey?",""
"I'll have a bottle of beaujolais instead then.",""
"Can you serve peanuts before noon, as I'm feeling a bit peckish?",""
"I suggest you take a break from alcohol.",""
"Really!",""
"It's not even noon yet and I haven't even started.",""
"I might have to take my custom elsewhere is you're not happy to serve me.",""
"I repeat, you've already taken four whiskeys.",""
"Are you going to take the wheel on your way out?",""
"I won't be leaving you a very good review on Tripadvisor.",""
"You call yourself a bar but won't serve me.",""
"Discriminating against alcoholics!",""
"I'm not allowed to serve drunk clients.",""
"I'm not drunk, I'm still standing!",""
"But your words are inconsistent, and I can't figure out if it's in effect from the slip of the Diabla translation, or a reflection of your mental state.",""
"Haha!",""
"I'm fine, it must be the Diabla, so I'll have another whiskey please!",""
"You're still up, but I suggest you go to bed.",""
"That will be my last word.",""
"The bar round the corner will serve me without a problem. They'll be glad of my custom.",""
"Good morning, Doctor.",""
"This is the first time I've been seeing a little nervous.",""
"So, how has your week been?",""
"I'm having trouble at work.",""
"Well, you have a very challenging job being a librarian.",""
"What exactly has happened?",""
"I feel like the staff aren't too many of them.",""
"I run around all day, following orders from my boss,",""
"Last time I felt like I had a panic attack, I locked myself in the bathroom to cry.",""
"I don't know what to do, what can you advise me?",""
"First of all, I think it's important that you get adequate support, so speak to your line manager and see if they can send staff possibly from another library to help your workload.",""
"It's a situation which is presently counter productive because if you are stressed and need to take time off, it will only make the staffing situation worse.",""
"Hopefully your boss will be able to appreciate that.",""
"I can give you some anti depressants.",""
"Would you be happy with that?",""
"Yeah, I could go talk to him, but I'm afraid, he's on edge right now.",""
"Last time he didn't greet me very well.",""
"Send him to me - I need more clients!",""
"He didn't greet you well?",""
"What exactly did he do?",""
"Haha, that would be an idea.",""
"Maybe he's gonna cry in the bathroom every once in a while.",""
"We should do group therapy.",""
"He didn't give me time to explain my situation, and threw me out of his office with more work than before!",""
"I would report him to someone higher up the chain.",""
"He may be suffering himself, but bullying you needs reporting.",""
"My goodness, your work environment doesn't sound very happy and uplifting.",""
"Perhaps someone is going around putting drugs in your food.",""
"Are your catering department reliable?",""
"I must admit, when I taste the meals we serve, I ask questions...",""
"Besides, there's no time to take a nap from the workload, it's a scandal!",""
"It sounds rather suspicious to me.",""
"If you could sneak out from there, some small food samples, I can send them away to get tested.",""
"You can taste it, but I'm warning you, it's terrible.",""
"Don't worry, I wouldn't taste it myself.",""
"If my suspicions are correct, to do so, would mean coming down with depression.",""
"I can't take time off and I like being happy.",""
"Anyway, lovely to see you again, and we'll speak again when you get the samples.",""
"Goodbye!",""
"Thank you for your help, Doctor.",""
"It was a pleasure talking to you today!",""
"It's a lovely day for feeding ducks.",""
"That's true, but I like to come here even when it rains.",""
"After all, ducks eat every day!",""
"Do you come here often?",""
"My first time at this particular pond.",""
"Are you new to the neighborhood?",""
"No, I am just passing through.",""
"I have a few hours to spare before catching my train.",""
"Oh, where are you going?",""
"Now that would be telling.",""
"Just on the way to Cirencester.",""
"The funny thing is I have no idea where I am now.",""
"We're in the Alan Turing Foundation.",""
"For me, it's especially the closest park in my house.",""
"And since he's got a pond and some ducks, I come here a lot.",""
"I like ducks a lot.",""
"How did Alan Turing find the park?",""
"I suppose he just looked around and there it was.",""
"lucky for me I had some bread in my bag or the ducks would have gone home with empty stomachs.",""
"I'll have some more if you want.",""
"I always bring too much.",""
"And there's a lot of kids, sometimes grown-ups, and they're happy that I give them some bread to throw in the ducks.",""
"No that is alright.",""
"I can hear my train whistle blwoing so I should run.",""
"Nice talking to you.",""
"Hello!",""
"How nice to see you!",""
"What a pleasure to meet you.",""
"How are you?",""
"I'm as well as can be expected.",""
"I've got my aches and pains but at 93 I can't grumble.",""
"How are you and the children?",""
"They must be growing up fast.",""
"It's hard sometimes to get old.",""
"I understand.",""
"And 93 is an age beyond honor and you always have a good eye.",""
"The kids are fine, thank you.",""
"They're almost grown now.",""
"Paul's studying architecture.",""
"That's marvellous.",""
"And what about Emma?",""
"She had a talent for music if I remember.",""
"Emma's a senior scientist in high school.",""
"She's graduating this year.",""
"She goes on with the music and part of a symphony orchestra.",""
"That's good to hear that she has kept the music up and will have a good career.",""
"I miss playing the piano.",""
"We don't have one here and the only music I do is to join in with the weekly song-song.",""
"Don't you have a chance to get a loan from a charity?",""
"I know there's a lot of musticists working with the nursing homes.",""
"Don't you ever perform with musicians?",""
"Just the weekly song?",""
"I don't know about loans.",""
"A piano is a big thing though it would be good if there was a keyboard.",""
"I could have a tinkle in that.",""
"The sing-song.",""
"- dear me, that is a dreadful thing.",""
"Terrible songs and my terrible singing"",""
"You're going to get addressed to the living council of the house.",""
"He could certainly put you in touch with a charity.",""
"Is it so bad the songs?",""
"What are they?",""
"From what era?",""
"I think I heard the bell for the evening meal.",""
"Will you stay for some food or do you have to leave now?",""
"We don't plan on staying for dinner and you know better than to call.",""
"I hope I can come back soon and we can arrange for me to stay for dinner with you.",""
"Thank you so much for coming to see me.",""
"it means so much to me to keep in touch.",""
"I hope you can come again soon.",""
"It was very nice to meet you, too.",""
"I'll be back.",""
"Maybe next week.",""
"These unfortunate ducks are very thin.",""
"Have you got bread to give?",""
"I have a few slices.",""
"It's been a hard winter for them and I don't think they've had very much to eat.",""
"They've started to build their nests, so they will need some fat on them for when they are sitting on eggs.",""
"Hey, you seem to know these brave ducks.",""
"Where did you learn all this?",""
"I'm a keen ornithologist.",""
"I spend weekends studying birds and looking for rare species.",""
"What are your hobbies?",""
"I see you're a specialist!",""
"I also like to walk around and listen to birds, but I don't know anything about it.",""
"What rare species are you looking for?",""
"Nightingales are quite rare.",""
"They sing beautifully.",""
"But when it comes to birdsong, I love the cheeky sound of the blackbird.",""
"I don't think you can beat waking up to the noisy sound of the birds.",""
"You've travelled in distant countries to see and listen to some very rare species?",""
"Yes, I was in Sri Lanka recently and saw some wonderful birds and animals.",""
"Have you travelled much?",""
"Yes, very much, especially in South America where there are extraordinary animals in the Amazon forest.",""
"Did you get a chance to get there?",""
"There's some amazing birds in Brazil.",""
"No, I would love to go to South America and particularly Brazil.",""
"It would be incredible to see a Toucan in the wild.",""
"I need to save up enough money to go there.",""
"Yes, a trip to South America costs enough.",""
"I'd like to go to Argentina and see the condors.",""
"I've heard that Argentina is a beautiful country too with stunning landscapes.",""
"It's a country I know very little about.",""
"I will have to do some research.",""
"We have to go south to Fire Nation.",""
"Chile too is a beautiful country.",""
"You'll find more animals there than those poor ducks!",""
"Hi, how are you?",""
"Hello, I am great thank you.",""
"How are you doing today?",""
"I'm fine.",""
"It's a good time to feed the ducks.",""
"Why is that?",""
"Because they are hungry",""
"They look hungry.",""
"What shall we give them to eat?",""
"I have heard that bread is not the best for them, what do you think?",""
"He was leaving that giving ducks bread is not good for them.",""
"Better give them carrots.",""
"Haha!",""
"The carrots might sink before they have a chance to eat them!",""
"It doesn't float carrots?",""
"If we reach out, maybe they'll come for lunch.",""
"At worst, they'll go down.",""
"Hopefully they won't sink while eating, that would be a sad lunchtime for them.",""
"Maybe we could try and stroke them?",""
"If we make duck noises they might come over!",""
"Shall we try?",""
"Yes!",""
"Let's try",""
"Corner little duck, come over here we have something to eat.",""
"Quack Quack",""
"Yes!",""
"He came over.",""
"He took the carrot from your hand!",""
"Let's just use it to stroke him before he leaves.",""
"Ah, too late.",""
"He got scared.",""
"All he left was feathers on the way out.",""
"Maybe he'll get caressed next time.",""
"We should go home.",""
"Good evening, my friend.",""
"How are you this evening?",""
"I've got terrible flatulence my friend.",""
"The food here is terrible!",""
"Oh, my poor old man.",""
"I brought you a bottle of wine, no one saw anything.",""
"Here, I'll hide it for you.",""
"Thanks but aren't you going to have some with me?",""
"It's up to you.",""
"You can keep it for yourself, we can drink from two, or we can also invite the nurse that I ran into the hallway when I came in.",""
"She's all right!",""
"Yes, it's fine.",""
"Most of the old folks in here don't know what day it is and wouldn't notice anyway!",""
"I know which nurse you mean - she gave me a nice massage earlier!",""
"Massage?",""
"Did you pay her for that, or do you think she likes you?",""
"Yes, the nurses gives us massages all the time.",""
"I get most of them though.",""
"The nurses seem to be queuing up!",""
"She wouldn't take any money from me.",""
"She says her services are free but I'm not sure what she means?",""
"Hmm, that's nice, but a little weird, isn't it?",""
"I mean, whatever!",""
"What matters is that there's a pretty nurse like that giving you massages.",""
"So, shall we open this bottle of wine?",""
"Yes, let's get it opened.",""
"I've got two nice wine glasses in my bedside cabinet.",""
"I've also got some playing cards here.",""
"Shall we invite one or two of the others and we can all play poker?",""
"That's a good idea.",""
"You want me to knock on doors, or do you have specific people in mind?",""
"Anybody, Just make sure you avoid door number 6.",""
"The lady in there is bonkers, and hurls abuse at everybody!",""
"All right, I'll look for people and I'll be right back!",""
"I'll be right back.",""
"I am worried about my mother.",""
"Tell me about your mother.",""
"Why are you worried about her?",""
"Well I am more worried about what she makes me do!",""
"Oh?",""
"What's she doing to you?",""
"I never seem to get any time on my own.",""
"She is always there.",""
"She tells you all the time what to do and how to do it?",""
"Well, no not really, but it's like she is watching me.",""
"And you feel like she's on trial?",""
"More like me being on trial.",""
"and I think she follows me...",""
"Is she following you?",""
"In town, everywhere?",""
"Not everywhere but yesterday I was in a coffee shop and I saw her at the door.",""
"When I looked up she was gone!",""
"Are you sure it was her?",""
"To be truthful...",""
"I am not sure anyone was there",""
"Who were you spying on?",""
"Why do you think I was spying?",""
"No, no, I was asking you who was spying on the door.",""
"It was a woman in a black coat carrying an umbrella",""
"She had long blonde hair tied in a bun.",""
"And your mother looks like that?",""
"sort off... it is like the photos of her as a young woman.",""
"But it probably wasn't her, then, was it?",""
"What did you have to do with your mother when you were a child?",""
"That's what I meant about not being sure anyone was there.",""
"I used to have a photo of her pinned on the wall next to my bed",""
"I used to cry a lot.",""
"I remember that",""
"Did she take care of you much?",""
"When she was at home yes, but I remember her being away from home a lot.",""
"Did you miss her when she was far away?",""
"Yes",""
"but I don't think she was that far away.",""
"Unfortunately, our time is up, it's time for my next patient.",""
"You'll be back next week, same time, same time?",""
"Thank you doctor",""
"yes I think my mother is waiting for me",""
"Good night",""
"Hey, you, did you just get in the neighborhood?",""
"This is the first time I've seen you, and you're at the regular table!",""
"Sorry.",""
"But I don't like being addressed as 'Hey, you.' How was I to know what table to sit at?",""
"I'll sit at the bar.",""
"If that's allowed?",""
"Oh, you've got character!",""
"Don't get upset!",""
"Can I get you something?",""
"Are you waiting for someone?",""
"I think we got off to a bad start.",""
"I'm not upset.",""
"Your tone seemed unwelcoming.",""
"I'll have a red wine and yes I'm waiting for a friend.",""
"Any more questions?",""
"I'm sorry I didn't want to rush you.",""
"I can offer you the wines of the days that are on the slate there.",""
"Is there a wine that is particularly local?",""
"You might be better off at the back table over there?",""
"It's kind of cozy, a little away from the rest of the customers.",""
"We only have local beer, wine comes from Bordeaux or the Coast of the Rhones.",""
"Ah I understand now.",""
"When you said regular table I thought I was sitting at another customer's regular table.",""
"Can I have a beer?",""
"Yes, you see, there are 12 and come every day at 2: 00.",""
"They are real drunks, I suggest you step away if your date is a little more...",""
"Sure, I'll bring the beer.",""
"OK.",""
"I see what you mean now.",""
"Thanks.",""

"Do you want me to keep you company?",""
"Oh that's very kind of you.",""
"She'll not be long.",""
"Let me introduce myself.",""
"My names Esther.",""
"What's yours?",""
"My name is Mathilde.",""
"Do you live around here?",""

"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow!",""
"Good afternoon to you!",""
"Good morning, Maria!",""
"How are you?",""
"So so.",""
"The leg's playing up a bit.",""
"And the nurses keep disturbing me every time I nod off.",""
"You can never get any peace around here!",""
"It's true, they spend their time bothering us.",""
"She's moving objects in the rooms.",""
"She tells us to go here, do that, pfft.",""
"Who's that?",""
"I can't see very well anymore.",""
"Why is there a woman in my room?",""
"And you shouldn't be complaining!",""
"You get to stay at home and live you life, while I'm stuck in here.",""
"I was kidding!",""
"They're doing it for your own good.",""
"For my own good?!",""
"That's it, that's it!",""
"You've been talking about me behind my back.",""
"They've turned you against me, I know it!",""
"Come on, come on, you know I would never do that!",""
"Tell me about your day.",""
"What did you eat?",""
"I knew it!",""
"You have been talking to the nurses.",""
"They've been trying to get me to eat all day.",""
"Except I'm too smart for them.",""
"I know they're trying to poison me you see.",""
"So I've kept a little stash of sweets here under my pillow.",""
"That way I'll never starve.",""
"Stop talking nonsense, they would never do that.",""
"It's spring, how about a way out in the park?",""
"We could arrange this for a weekend of May.",""
"I'll ask Marcel, Jeannine and Leon if they want to come.",""
"I'm not friends with Jeannine anymore.",""
"She keeps stealing my crossword.",""
"And I'm sure she snogged Leon behind the medicine cupboard last Thursday.",""
"Too bad, we'll do it without them!",""
"Hello there",""
"Good evening.",""
"How are you?",""
"Very well thanks, and you?",""
"How do you think you are getting on with your Maths exam revision?",""
"I'm fine, thank you very much.",""
"I'm not sure, actually.",""
"I'm having a little trouble understanding the differential equations.",""
"Can you help me, please?",""
"Of course!",""
"What exactly are you struggling to get the hang of?",""
"Unfortunately, I didn't understand the last sentence, can you rephrase that?",""
"Of course - which concepts are you needing assistance with?",""
"Thank you.",""
"I need an explanation about derivatives.",""
"I'm having trouble understanding the principle.",""
"No problem - is it differentiation or integration you're needing help with the principle of?",""
"Is it okay that the exam will cover all of the concepts that you saw in the second semester?",""
"Yes, everything in Term 2 will be assessed in full.",""
"Is there anything further I can help with today?",""

"Come with me!",""
"It'll do you good, you'll see",""
"Plus I have a frisbee!",""
"It'll be fun!",""
"But we need more people to play proper frisbee.",""

"Haha",""

"Why would I be ashamed?",""
"I know that I'm pretty good.",""
"I don't need to prove it!",""
